        "long_description": "Three Chinese nationals have been arrested with 12 gold bars and $800,000 (\u00a3650,000) in cash in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, officials say. The gold and money was hidden under the seats of the vehicle they were travelling in, according to Jean Jacques Purusi, the governor of South Kivu province. He said the operation to arrest the men had been kept secret after the recent release of another group of Chinese nationals accused of running an illegal gold mine in the area. Eastern DR Congo has abundant reserves of gold, diamonds and the minerals used to make batteries for mobile phones and electric vehicles. This mineral wealth has been plundered by foreign groups since the colonial era and is one of the main reasons why the region has been plagued by instability for the last 30 years. Militia groups control many of the mines in eastern DR Congo and their leaders become wealthy by selling it to middle-men. Purusi said some of these dealers in precious metals enjoyed good relations with influential people in the capital, Kinshasa, and this was why the mission to carry out these latest arrests had to be kept quiet. He said they had been acting on a tip-off and that the gold and money was only found after a meticulous search of the vehicle in the Walungu area not far from the border with Rwanda. He did not say exactly how much gold had been seized. Last month, the governor told reporters he was shocked to hear that 17 Chinese nationals, who had been arrested on allegations they had been running an illegal gold mine, had been freed and allowed to return to China. He said this undermined efforts to clean up DR Congo's notoriously murky mineral sector. They owed $10m in taxes and fines to the government, the Reuters news agency quotes him as saying. The Chinese embassy has not commented on the allegations. The arrests come as fighting continues to flare in the neighbouring North Kivu province, where a Rwanda-backed rebel group has captured large areas of territory. Last month, DR Congo said it was suing Apple over the use of \"blood minerals\", prompting the tech giant to say it had stopped getting supplies from both DR Congo and neighbouring Rwanda. Rwanda has denied being a conduit for the export of illegal minerals from DR Congo. In their lawsuit, lawyers acting for the Congolese government alleged that the minerals taken from conflict areas was then \"laundered through international supply chains\". \"These activities have fuelled a cycle of violence and conflict by financing militias and terrorist groups and have contributed to forced child labour and environmental devastation,\" they said.

        "title": "Tanzania's fuel revolution slowed down by lack of filling stations",
        "short_description": "A revolution in vehicle fuel is gaining momentum in Tanzania, but a lack of filling stations means it is stuck in second gear.",
        "long_description": "A revolution in vehicle fuel is gaining momentum in Tanzania, but a lack of filling stations means it is stuck in second gear. Like Nigeria and some other countries on the continent, Tanzania is beginning to embrace compressed natural gas (CNG) as an alternative to petrol and diesel. It is seen as cleaner and better for the environment than those fossil fuels, but its relative cheapness is the biggest draw for the 5,000 or so motorists in the East African state who have embraced the change - particularly commercial drivers. This represents a small fraction of Tanzania's vehicles, but the early adopters are paving the way for a wider acceptance of CNG - the government reportedly wants near total adoption by the middle of the century. Tanzania has large reserves of gas under the sea and for those filling up, CNG can cost less than half its petrol equivalent. The potential saving was enough to persuade taxi owner Samuel Amos Irube to part with about 1.5m Tanzanian shillings ($620; \u00a3495) to convert his three-wheeled vehicle \u2013 known locally as a bajaji - to CNG. But now, having to get the gas twice a day, he often spends more time waiting at a filling station in the largest city, Dar es Salaam, than he does earning money. There are only four places in Tanzania's commercial hub where he can fill up. Quietly frustrated, he says he has to wait for at least three hours every time he wants to refuel, but the savings make it worth it, as he spends just 40% of what he would on the equivalent amount of petrol. The slow-moving queues of vehicles at the Ubungo CNG station snake down the road. Things are orderly \u2013 there are three clear lines, one for cars and two for bajajis \u2013 but the irritation is palpable. Medadi Kichungo Ngoma, in the queue for two hours already, stares at the vehicles ahead of him as he waits by his silver pick-up truck. He tells the BBC that he was among the first people in the city to convert his vehicle, which involved installing a large cylinder in the back of the pick-up, and reminisces about the short queues. \"Sometimes the attendant would have to be called to serve us,\" he says. He complains that the infrastructure has not expanded to accommodate the increasing demand. This is also the refrain heard at the largest of the city's CNG filling stations near the airport. Sadiki Christian Mkumbuka has waited here for three hours with his bajaji. \"The queue is very long,\" he says, adding that \"we should have as many stations as there are for petrol vehicles\". But the price consideration will keep people coming back. \"I pay 15,000 shillings ($6; \u00a35) to fill my 11kg gas tank, which goes for about 180km,\" says another motorist who introduces himself as Juma, adding that this is less than half the cost for petrol to cover the same distance. The push to encourage motorists to adopt CNG-powered vehicles in Tanzania was hatched over a decade ago but did not begin in earnest until 2018. Those in charge of the project acknowledge that they did not foresee the rapid rise in demand. Aristides Kato, the CNG project manager at the state-oil firm, the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), tells the BBC that there \"has been a very drastic increase\" recently in the use of natural gas by vehicle owners. \"We found ourselves not having enough infrastructure to support the demand for gas-using vehicles,\" he admits. The authorities, though, want more people to switch to CNG because it is a relatively clean-burning fossil fuel that results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants, according to the UN. Plus the locally available natural gas should allow for cheaper prices than petrol. But the cost of converting a vehicle plus the lower mileage that a full tank gives a motorist compared to petrol or diesel may be putting some people off. However, the country manager of Taqa Arabia, an Egyptian company that runs the filling station near the airport, sees the growing demand as a \"positive sign that CNG use has started to develop in Tanzania\". Amr Aboushady says his firm plans to build more stations and hopes to \"replicate our success story in Egypt by helping the [Tanzanian] government best utilise natural gas as an affordable, reliable, cleaner source of energy\". Egypt has pioneered the use of CNG on the continent, with about half a million vehicles converted to a dual-fuel system since the 1990s. Other African countries that have approved CNG use for vehicles include South Africa, Kenya, Mozambique and Ethiopia. The authorities in Tanzania are committed to rolling out more infrastructure and hope to encourage more private investors to get involved. A central CNG \"mother station\" is being built in Dar es Salaam by TPDC, which will supply gas to smaller stations around the country. In addition, TPDC is acquiring five mobile CNG units that will be located in Dar es Salaam as well as the capital, Dodoma, and Morogoro. These measures should in the medium-term lead to shorter queues, but for the time being the lack of filling stations will continue to frustrate Tanzania's CNG pioneers.

        "short_description": "The first congestion charge scheme for vehicles in the US has come into effect in New York City.",
        "long_description": "The first congestion charge scheme for vehicles in the US has come into effect in New York City. Car drivers will pay up to $9 (\u00a37) a day, with varying rates for other vehicles. The congestion zone covers an area south of central park, taking in well known sites such as the Empire State Building, Times Square and the financial district around Wall Street The scheme aims to ease New York's notorious traffic problems and raise billions for the public transport network, but has faced resistance, including from famous New Yorker and President-elect Donald Trump. New York state Governor Kathy Hochul made the case for a congestion charge two years ago, but it was delayed and revised following complaints from some commuters and businesses. The new plan revives one scheme that she paused in June, saying there were \"too many unintended consequences for New Yorkers\". Most drivers will be charged $9 once per day to enter the congestion zone at peak hours, and $2.25 at other times. Small trucks and non-commuter buses will pay $14.40 to enter Manhattan at peak times, while larger trucks and tourist buses will pay a $21.60 fee. The charge has been met with plenty of opposition, including from taxi drivers' associations. But its most high-profile opposition has come from Trump, a native New Yorker who has vowed to kill the scheme when he returns to office this month. Local Republicans have already asked him to intervene. Congressman Mike Lawler, who represents a suburban district just north of New York City, asked Trump in November to commit to \"ending this absurd congestion pricing cash grab once and for all\". A judge denied an 11th-hour effort Friday by neighbouring New Jersey state officials to block the scheme on grounds of its environmental impact on adjoining areas. Last year, New York City was named the world's most-congested urban area for the second year in a row, according to INRIX, a traffic-data analysis firm. Vehicles in downtown Manhattan drove at a speed of 11mph (17km/h) during peak morning periods in the first quarter of last year, the report said.

        "long_description": "Hamas has posted a video showing a 19-year-old Israeli captive, as indirect talks between the group and Israel on a ceasefire and hostage release deal resume in Qatar. The footage shows Liri Albag calling for the Israeli government to reach a deal. She was taken hostage along with six other female conscript soldiers at the Nahal Oz army base on the Gaza border during Hamas's October 2023 attack. Five of them remain in captivity. The announcement of renewed talks came as Israel intensified attacks on Gaza, with the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry saying on Sunday that 88 people had been killed in bombardment over the past 24 hours. One strike on a home in Gaza City on Saturday killed 11 people including seven children, according to the Gaza civil defence agency. Images showed residents searching through rubble for survivors and the bodies of the dead wrapped in shrouds. \"A huge explosion woke us up. Everything was shaking,\" neighbour Ahmed Mussa told AFP. \"It was home to children, women. There wasn't anyone wanted or who posed a threat.\" The Israeli military said on Sunday that it had struck more than 100 \"terror targets\" in the Gaza Strip over the past two days and \"eliminated dozens of Hamas terrorists\" Responding to the video showing their daughter, Liri Albag's parents said it had torn their hearts to pieces and they appealed to the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \"make decisions as if your own children were there\". The Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters, which represents hostage families, said the sign of life from Liri was \"harsh and undeniable proof of the urgency in bringing all the hostages home\". In a call to Lira Albag's parents, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said his country's delegation would remain at the negotiating table until all hostages were returned home. Israeli officials have previously described the release of such videos by Hamas as psychological warfare. Last month a senior Palestinian official told the BBC that talks to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal were mostly complete, but key issues still needed to be bridged. On Sunday the Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen, the latest in a series of such attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi movement. The Houthis said they had fired a \"hypersonic ballistic missile\" towards a power station near the Israeli city of Haifa. The group says it began targeting shipping in the Red Sea and firing projectiles at Israel in response to Israeli military actions in Gaza. The current war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage. Israel's military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed more than 45,800 people, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On Saturday the Gaza health ministry said all three government hospitals in northern Gaza were completely out of service and \"destroyed\" by the Israeli military. The Israeli military has imposed a blockade on parts of northern Gaza since October, with the UN saying the area has been under \"near-total siege\" as Israeli forces heavily restrict access of aid deliveries to an area where an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people remain. Late last month the Israeli military forced patients and medical staff to leave Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia, alleging the facility was a \"Hamas terrorist stronghold\" and arresting the hospital director Hussam Abu Safiya. It said it had facilitated the transfer of some medical staff and patients to the Indonesian hospital nearby. But the Gaza health ministry said on Saturday that that hospital had also been taken out of service, along with the hospital in Beit Hanoun. World Health Organisation chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus again called for an end to attacks on hospitals and health professionals. \"People in Gaza need access to health care,\" he said. Israel says its forces operate in accordance with international law and do not target civilians. On Saturday the Biden administration said it was planning an $8bn (\u00a36.4bn) arms sale to Israel. The weapons consignment, which needs approval from US House and Senate committees, includes missiles, shells and other munitions. The move comes just over a fortnight before Biden leaves office and Donald Trump takes over as president. Washington has consistently rejected calls to suspend military backing for Israel because of the number of civilians killed in Gaza. What the conflict in 2024 means for 2025... Israel claimed responsibility for the strikes, saying it had targeted Houthi \"military infrastructure\". It also said that soldiers did not know the hostages were there when they began their operation. Four rioters are jailed after a Europa League match between Ajax and Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv.

        "long_description": "Sushi restaurateurs in Tokyo say they have paid 207m yen ($1.3m; \u00a31m) for a bluefin tuna which is about the size and weight of a motorbike. The sale is the second highest price ever paid at the annual new year auction at Toyosu Fish Market in the Japanese capital. Onodera Group, which had the winning bid, said the tuna - which weighs in at 276kg (608lb) - would be served at its Michelin-starred Ginza Onodera restaurants, as well as Nadaman restaurants across the country. \"The first tuna is something meant to bring in good fortune,\" Onodera official Shinji Nagao told reporters after the auction, news agency AFP reported. Mr Nagao added that he hoped people would eat the tuna - caught off the Aomori region in northern Japan - and \"have a wonderful year\". The group has paid the top price in the Ichiban Tuna auction for five years straight. Last year, it forked out 114m yen for the top tuna. The highest auction price since comparable records began in 1999 was 333.6m yen in 2019 for a 278kg bluefin. It was paid by self-styled Japanese \"Tuna King\" and sushi restaurant owner Kiyoshi Kimura. Toyosu fish market, which opened in 1935, claims to be the biggest fish market in the world, and is known for pre-dawn daily tuna auctions. But tuna was not the only catch on offer on Sunday, with Hokkaido sea urchins also fetching a record-breaking 7m yen according to the Japan Times. Ms Itooka lived through two world wars and was credited with a sprightly spirit all her life. Biden decided to scrap the deal despite concerns that it could damage Washington's relations with Tokyo.

        "long_description": "January 5, 2025 12:39 pm Tax expert N.R. Gajendran says Sri Lanka\u2019s inability to meet tax revenue targets despite tax hikes is due to the tax leakages spurred by tax evasion. Joining Ada Derana\u2019s current affairs program \u201c@HydePark\u201d, Gajendran further expressed that digitalization of proceedings of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) will significantly contribute to bolstering efficiency while also eradicating loopholes which facilitate tax evasion. \u201cAll the taxes have gone up, but we\u2019re still struggling to achieve 13.9% to 14% tax revenue. Next year, 2025, we\u2019re hoping to reach 15%, which is still below what we achieved in the early 90s, 22% tax to GDP ratio. Most of the countries, even developing countries achieve 18% - 22% taxes\u201d, Gajendran mentioned. \u201cIf you want to have macroeconomic stability, when we consider a developed country, tax to GDP ratio should be about 28% - 30%. Now we still have this gap. We\u2019re collecting so much from people and we\u2019re still falling short. Next year, at our best, we\u2019ll reach 15%. We had 22% before, in 2022. Where is this 5% - 7% gap? I\u2019m telling, that is the evasion and fraud and corruption\u201d, he added. \u201cThis money is not with the small taxpayers. It is with the big taxpayers. Reforms cannot take place when it is corrupt. If higher-ups are corrupt, all subordinates will be corrupt, as the former President said,\u201d Gajendran emphasized. Meanwhile, Tax Consultant, Attorney-at-Law Suresh Perera revealed that tax evasion is most often committed by top tax payers and not those in the lower tax brackets, although they have been at the centre of attention when drafting tax legislation. Commenting regarding the matter, Perera emphasized the tax leakage exists due to improper enforcement of laws, reiterating that the tax leakage takes place due to evasion by top tax payers. \u201cThe law is there, but it\u2019s not been followed. What is happening in here is that now the focus is on small man,\u201d perera added. Furthermore, he emphasized that policymakers focus on individual tax payers, stressing that the policies should be made focusing on large corporations, from which a huge tax revenue is being collected.

        "long_description": "January 4, 2025 09:34 pm Russia has vowed retaliation after claiming to have shot down eight US-made ATACMS missiles fired by Ukraine on Saturday morning. Moscow sees the use of such missiles, which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles), as a major escalation. The country\u2019s air defenses shot down the eight ballistic missiles alongside 72 aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense said. It added that \u201cthese actions by the Kyiv regime, which is supported by Western curators, will be met with retaliation.\u201d The statement said several drones were destroyed in the Leningrad region in the north-west and one in Kursk, where Ukraine launched a surprise attack late last summer. The outgoing US President Joe Biden approved Kyiv\u2019s use of ATACMS in November \u2013 saying in part it was in response to Russia expanding the conflict by deploying North Korean troops. Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to respond to Ukrainian strikes using ATACMS with Russia\u2019s new nuclear-capable ballistic missile \u201cOreshnik.\u201d Last month, Putin suggested that it could be fired at the capital Kyiv as a test of Western-supplied air defense systems. The first and only launch of the experimental weapon targeted Ukraine\u2019s Dnipro region on the morning of November 21. The Ukrainian drone attacks forced temporary restrictions to be introduced at an airport in St. Petersburg, Russian state media agency TASS reported. The governor of Leningrad oblast, Aleksandr Drozdenko, said in a statement on Telegram that the \u201cnight and morning of January 4 were record-breaking in terms of the number of UAVs destroyed,\u201d with four shot down over his region. A Ukrainian security official, Andrii Kovalenko, said a seaport in Leningrad was targeted, calling it an \u201cinstrument of economic and military survival for Russia in isolation.\u201d Meanwhile, Russia launched a total of 81 drones at Ukraine overnight on Friday into Saturday, according to Ukraine\u2019s Air Force Command, including Iranian-made Shahed drones and \u201cvarious types of imitation drones.\u201d Some 34 Shahed attack UAVs and other types of drones were downed, according to a statement, although the downed drones caused damage in the Chernihiv and Sumy regions. Ukraine enters the year on the back foot in the conflict, which began with in February 2022, with Russian making gains on the eastern frontlines. Russia\u2019s defense ministry said on Saturday that its forces had taken control of the village of Nadiya in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Luhansk region. In Donetsk, the hub of Pokrovsk is under growing Russian pressure as Ukrainian forces lose ground to the south and east of the town. Ukraine is also concerned that the incoming Trump administration could cut vital military aid; Trump himself has vowed to end the conflict. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "long_description": "January 5, 2025 07:16 pm The Office of the Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, has categorically denied any involvement in the cancellation of the scheduled lecture organized by the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) at Peradeniya University. Issuing a statement, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said that Dr. Amarasuriya has consistently championed academic freedom and democratic engagement, values fundamental to fostering critical discourse in educational institutions. The allegations suggesting that the Prime Minister and Minister of Education influenced the university\u2019s decision to cancel the lecture are entirely baseless and misleading, the statement highlighted. Furthermore, the Office of the Prime Minister and Minister of Education has assured that no directive or instruction was issued from this office regarding the event, noting that the autonomy of academic institutions is a principle that the government is committed to upholding. \u201cUniversities must remain places where diverse opinions, including critiques of government policies, can be freely expressed and discussed without fear of suppression. Nevertheless, we express concern about any action that undermines democratic expression and open dialogue within academic spaces\u201d, it added. The statement also added that Dr. Amarasuriya reaffirms her unwavering commitment to protecting the rights of students and educators to engage in meaningful and critical discourse, mentioning that upholding these principles is vital to maintaining the trust and confidence of the university community and the public at large.",

        "title": "Biden plans to send $8bn arms shipment to Israel",
        "short_description": "January 5, 2025 10:47 am",
        "long_description": "January 5, 2025 10:47 am The US Department of State has notified Congress of a planned $8bn (\u00a36.4bn) arms sale to Israel, an American official has confirmed to the BBC. The weapons consignment, which needs approval from House and Senate committees, includes missiles, shells and other munitions. The move comes just over a fortnight before President Joe Biden leaves office. Washington has rejected calls to suspend military backing for Israel because of the number of civilians killed during the war in Gaza. In August, the US approved the sale of $20bn in fighter jets and other military equipment to Israel. The latest planned shipment contains air-to-air missiles, Hellfire missiles, artillery shells and bombs, the US official said. A source familiar with the sale told the BBC on Saturday: \u201cThe president has made clear Israel has a right to defend its citizens, consistent with international law and international humanitarian law, and to deter aggression from Iran and its proxy organisations. \u201cWe will continue to provide the capabilities necessary for Israel\u2019s defence.\u201d Biden has often described US support for Israel as iron-clad. The US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, having helped it build one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the US accounted for 69% of Israel\u2019s imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023. In May 2024, the US confirmed it had paused a single consignment of 2,000lb and 500lb bombs over concerns Israel was going ahead with a major ground operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. But Biden immediately faced a backlash from Republicans in Washington and from Netanyahu who appeared to compare it to an \u201carms embargo\u201d. Biden has since partially lifted the suspension and not repeated it. The planned shipment is one of a number of steps taken by the Biden administration in recent weeks, as the outgoing president attempts to shore up his legacy. It will likely also be the last planned weapons sale to Israel before he leaves the White House on 20 January 2025, when his successor Donald Trump is inaugurated. The president-elect has previously spoken of ending foreign conflicts, and of reducing US involvement, including during his re-election bid. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel, but has urged the American ally to finish its military operation in Gaza quickly. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group\u2019s unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 45,580 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "long_description": "January 5, 2025 11:32 am Sri Lanka Police have taken steps to implement two traffic operations aimed at reducing road accidents and easing traffic congestion, in line with the \u2018Clean Sri Lanka\u2019 national initiative. The first operation targets vehicles with various horns, additional flashing lights of different colors, illegal modifications, loud horns, loud silencers, and additional parts that could contribute to accidents and road hazards.
