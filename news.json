        "short_description": "Donald Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to halt his sentencing in the criminal hush money case, which is set for Friday.",
        "long_description": "Donald Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to halt his sentencing in the criminal hush money case, which is set for Friday. The eleventh-hour filing comes after two lower courts rejected Trump's efforts to block the proceedings. The president-elect's lawyers have now asked the nation's top court to consider whether he is entitled to an automatic stay of his sentencing while he appeals against his conviction. Allowing the sentencing to proceed would cause \"grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency\", his lawyers wrote. They argue that the case should not proceed as scheduled until questions around presidential immunity are resolved. Trump's lawyers asked the judges to consider \"whether a sitting president's complete immunity from criminal prosecution during his term in office extends to the president-elect of the United States\". Last year, the Supreme Court issued a sweeping decision granting US presidents immunity from criminal prosecution over official acts conducted while in office. Trump's lawyers have argued to a Manhattan judge and higher courts that the immunity protections should apply in his New York criminal case as well. They have also argued that the case should be put on hold due to his imminent return to the White House. On Wednesday, shortly after the filing, the Supreme Court gave Manhattan prosecutors until Thursday morning to respond to Trump's request. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a brief statement: \"We will respond in court papers.\" A jury unanimously found Trump guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May after a dramatic six-week trial. The conviction stemmed from Trump's attempt to disguise a reimbursement for a $130,000 hush-money payment made to an adult film star, who said she had a past sexual encounter with Trump. Manhattan prosecutors argued that the scheme was tantamount to election interference, because the payment occurred just days before the 2016 election and kept a potentially damaging story from voters. Trump denies the encounter and any wrongdoing. He was originally set to be sentenced in July, but Justice Merchan granted a delay as the presidential election played out. Subsequent sentencing dates in September and November were also moved. Trump's lawyers have also unsuccessfully sought to have the conviction thrown out entirely. Justice Juan Merchan indicated in a recent ruling that he will not consider a jail term for Trump, but rather lower-level punishments. As well as Wednesday's emergency Supreme Court petition, Trump's lawyers are also trying to stop the release of a final report from US Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith. He led two federal prosecutions against Trump on charges he interfered in the 2020 election and allegations he mishandled classified documents after leaving office. Both cases are now defunct because justice department policy prevents prosecutions of a sitting president, but Smith has submitted a final report to the US attorney general. Two of Trump's co-defendants in the classified documents case, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, have appealed to stop the justice department from making that report public. On Tuesday, US District Judge Aileen Cannon temporarily granted their request and blocked the release. They have also launched a parallel appeal with a higher court. On Wednesday, the justice department asked the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to reject Mr Nauta and Mr De Oliveira's bid to block the report's release. In their filing, they stated US Attorney General Merrick Garland planned to release the first part of the report dealing with the federal election interference case. However, they said Garland would withhold the second part of the report related to the classified documents investigation while Trump's two remaining co-defendants appeal. A high school that appeared in films such as Carrie is said to have been impacted by blazes, according to an official. The EU's two leading members were reacting to the US president-elect's plans to acquire Denmark's autonomous territory. The outgoing president also says he is considering pardons for Trump foes. Antal Rogan is one of the most powerful men in Orban's government and heads his cabinet office. Though the president-elect's rhetoric is unusual, for over a century a succession of US presidents have tried to gain control of Greenland. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

        "short_description": "The mother of a 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in south-east London has said she is not surprised her son was killed.",
        "long_description": "The mother of a 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in south-east London has said she is not surprised her son was killed. Kelyan Bokassa was groomed by gangs from the age of six years old, his mother Mary Bokassa said. He died shortly after being attacked on a 472 double-decker bus on Woolwich Church Street on Tuesday afternoon. No arrests have been made, but detectives say they are \"working at pace\" to find those responsible. Speaking to the BBC from her flat in Greenwich, Ms Bokassa described Kelyan as \"caring, very caring\" and kind. However she said he had previously been found to have taken knives into his primary school and was taken into care for a number of years. She added Kelyan was \"underweight, very hungry, tattooed and exposed to drugs\" and he experienced some \"extremely challenging times\", but they had just enjoyed Christmas together and he was back at school. She said she asked for help and tried to prevent him from associating with gangs but did not receive support from the authorities, and her son \"still had one foot on the streets\". As a result, she said she was traumatised and shocked by his death, but not surprised. According to court documents seen by the BBC, Kelyan was due in court next week facing a charge of carrying a machete. \"He cares about the people around him. He loved to have his friends around and when they were round he would want to cook for them,\" Ms Bokassa added in a tearful tribute to her son. \"He was very articulate. \"He knows what he likes and knows how to express it. \"He was good in music. Anything he loves... he was doing to his best ability. He was good at football... and he was was extremely good at drawing.\" Kelyan attended Newhaven School, a pupil referral unit and specialist school in Eltham. Head teacher Jon Kelly said: \"We are devastated at the tragic death of this funny, kind and ambitious young man. \"It comes at a time when he was working incredibly hard at school to build on the successes he had already achieved since joining us.\" Mr Kelly said his thoughts were with Kelyan's family and friends at \"this unimaginably difficult time\". St Columba's Catholic Boys' School in Bexleyheath confirmed Kelyan attended the school in 2022. Paul Drake, the chief operating officer of the academy trust that runs the school, said staff and pupils were \"saddened\" by his death. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time,\" he said. \"Our schools will provide support to any of the students who may be affected by this senseless violence.\" St Mary Magdalene Church in Woolwich plans to hold a vigil in Kelyan's memory this evening. Police, paramedics and the London Air Ambulance were called to the scene on Tuesday at about 14:30 GMT after the alert was raised by an officer on patrol. Medics tried to treat his injuries, but he died soon afterwards. Kelyan's death comes just three months after another teenage boy lost his life to knife crime in Woolwich. Daejaun Campbell, 15, was stabbed to death in Eglinton Road on 22 September last year, less than a mile-and-a-half away from Tuesday's stabbing. He was among 11 teenage boys who lost their lives to homicide in London in 2024. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "title": "How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war",
        "short_description": "For years, a controversial invader has been gradually taking over Australia's beloved beaches.",
        "long_description": "For years, a controversial invader has been gradually taking over Australia's beloved beaches. Swallowing up the sand, blocking ocean views and turning the shore into an irksome maze is a sea of large beach tents, called cabanas in Australia. \"It's chokkas. They're all over the place,\" Sydneysider Claire, 30, told the BBC. For her \u2013 and most Australians \u2013 cooling off on a sweltering day means a solid drive to the coast, plus an eternity hunting down a park. Now, the cabana craze means there's another battle waiting for them on the beach. Polyester shade covers flap in the breeze as far as the eye can see. Some are empty, set up at the crack of dawn and then abandoned for hours on end, until the owners actually want to use them. \"The sheer amount of space that people are taking up\u2026 [when] you're just trying to find a free square inch of sand to lay your towel, it can just be a little bit frustrating,\" Claire says. She's not alone in her irritation. Several summers of simmering tension has, in the first days of 2025, exploded into a full-on turf war, sparking debate about Australian culture and beach etiquette. A row over the acceptable use of cabanas has dominated social media, spawned a wave of opinion pieces and television segments, and has even dragged in the prime minister. Self-described \"haters\" say entitled cabana crews are hogging public space and disrespecting other beachgoers. \"When you're\u2026 polluting the beach with your four cabanas next to each other, where is Guncle Nic going to go,\" anti-cabana crusader and TikToker Nic Salerno said on TV talk show The Project. \"I just want my space on the beach, guys.\" But the pro-cabana mob say seeking protection from Australia's vicious sun isn't a crime - and it's every man for themselves. Australia is the melanoma capital of the world, and many supporters \u2013 including national charity, the Cancer Council \u2013 argue the new trend should actually be celebrated. \"My partner and I have a cool cabana because we both burn extremely easily and we don't want to die of skin cancer by 30, hope this helps,\" one person wrote, responding to a TikTok rant. No-one is discounting the importance of sun safety, the cabana critics counter, but they say that's just a convenient excuse for many of the people using the beach tents. Half the time they're not even sitting under the shade covers, they claim, and there's no need for two people to whip out an entire tent for an hour or two, when sun-cream and hat will do just fine. Other cabana devotees are more forward about their motivations. Breakfast television presenter Davina Smith admitted that for her, it is about nabbing \"the prime piece of real estate\" on busy beaches. She is one of the people who pitch their cabana castles in the early morning to reserve territory for her family later that day. \"There's a lot of research that goes into this. You get up early, you've got to watch the tides. You can't just plonk it there and walk away\u2026 you invest in it,\" Smith argued on the Today programme. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the hordes irked by the trend: \"That's not on,\" he told the same show. \"One of the great things about Australia, unlike some parts of the world, you go and you got to pay to go to the beach. Here, everyone owns the beach\u2026 And that's a breach of that principle, really.\" Even lifeguards have opinions on the matter, with some telling local media the cabana camps can make it hard for them to do their jobs. There are a number of cultural quirks which mean Cabanagate has Australians more worked up than a magpie in spring. Firstly, the country loves to think of itself as an egalitarian society \u2013 the land of a \"fair go\" \u2013 and that extends to the use of one of its most precious national assets. \"Australian beaches, they always have been seen as shared spaces, democratic spaces where social hierarchies dissolve\u2026. [they're] seen as a great equaliser,\" says Ece Kaya, a researcher at the University of Technology Sydney. And Australians are \"fiercely\" protective of that ideal: \"They see it as a birthright,\" says Chris Pepin-Neff, who studies Australian beach culture. He points to the backlash in 1929 when beachgoers at Sydney's Coogee Beach were forced to pay for access to the only part of the water covered by shark nets. More recently, a bid to rent out part of Bondi Beach to an exclusive beach club was met with a huge outcry. And while the use of sprawling cabanas is a relatively new phenomenon, there's long been \"enormous class tension\" around the use of the country's coastline, Pepin-Neff adds. A lack of infrastructure, affordable housing and community attitudes tend to lock ordinary Australians out of waterfront areas, while those natural assets are often used by those lucky enough to live there. \"And there's a perception that it's encroaching even further, [so] that an average family can't even get a spot at the beach.\" But he says there's no real data on who is using cabanas and why. He also argues there's many good reasons people might use them. Maybe they've travelled a long way so they plan to stay at the beach longer, or they may have a disability or young children they need to cater for, he says. \"There is a balance between a free and open beach that everybody can use, and making sure that you're respectful.\" He offers no defence for the \"land bankers\" though: \"As a Sydneysider, I think that is abusing the privilege\u2026 that is not a fair go.\" As the debate intensifies though, there are some calls for a truce to restore the peace to Australian shores. Beachkit Australia founder Rowan Clark, who sells equipment including cabanas, told the Sydney Morning Herald even he thinks cabana lovers should be more courteous. \"They should only allow set up at the rear of the beach in a line,\" he said. \"Once this is exhausted, then no more of this style of shade should be allowed.\" Others want authorities to rein it in, like some have in the United States. There are suggestions councils could limit how many cabanas can be set up on their beaches, and where. But Sydney resident Claire, for all her wrath, worries that could tip the scales in the other direction and exclude other people from using the beach. \"You don't want to get too precious about it, obviously\u2026 it's just the beach, first world problems right? \"I think in general, we should just try to be considerate of one another.\" Australia have joined South Africa in June's World Test Championship final - BBC Sport looks at the points table, how it all works and how you can follow the final.

Officials say the blaze grew from 20 acres to more than 200 acres in about 20 minutes after it was reported about 10:30 local time (18:30 GMT).

        "long_description": "January 7, 2025 09:24 pm Two individuals were killed in a shooting incident early this morning (07) on Watarappala Road, Mount Lavinia, which had been carried out by two unidentified gunmen. According to police, the gunmen had arrived at a residence on a motorcycle around 4:25 a.m. and opened fire using a 9mm pistol and a homemade \u2018Galkatas\u2019 handgun. The victims have been identified as Sudath Gomes alias Mano, 36, who died on the spot, and Chanaka Vimukthi alias Sandun, 20, who succumbed to his injuries after being admitted to the Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Kalubowila. The identity of the two gunmen who fled the scene after the shooting has not yet been determined. Police suspect the incident is tied to a longstanding feud between two drug traffickers infamously knowns as \u2018Badowita Asanka\u2019 and \u2018Kosmalli\u2019, both who are believed to be operating from overseas. Police allege that the attack was carried out by associates of \u2018Kosmalli\u2019, as the two victims had connections with drug trafficker \u2018Badowita Asanka\u2019. Additionally, police noted that the shooting occurred in the wake of the arrests of the grandmother and a brother of one of the shooting victims in connection with drug trade last night (06). The investigation at the scene of the crime was led by Mount Lavinia Magistrate Chathurika Silva and further investigations are being conducted under the direction of the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) of Western Province (South) Division, Gayanga Marapana.",

        "title": "Tens of thousands flee as wildfires tear through Los Angeles area",
        "short_description": "January 8, 2025 06:23 pm",
        "long_description": "January 8, 2025 06:23 pm More than 30,000 people evacuated their homes as a wildfire ripped through an upscale coastal area of Los Angeles on Tuesday and into Wednesday, with Hollywood celebrities among those fleeing by car and on foot as flames engulfed homes and set hillsides ablaze. Two other fires inland were also spreading fast, officials said. Numerous buildings were destroyed and nearly 3,000 acres (1,200 hectares) burned in the Pacific Palisades area between the beach towns of Santa Monica and Malibu, officials said. The area is home to many film and music stars. Roads were jammed with people fleeing the inferno, some abandoning their cars as flames licked the edges, and plumes of smoke and flames rose in the night sky over Los Angeles and its suburbs. Firefighters has not contained the blaze by the early hours and Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency. Pacific Palisades resident Cindy Festa said that as she evacuated, fires were \u201cthis close to the cars,\u201d demonstrating with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cPeople left their cars on Palisades Drive. Burning up the hillside. The palm trees - everything is going,\u201d Festa said from her car. A fire official told local television station KTLA that several people were injured in the Palisades Fire, some with burns to faces and hands. One female firefighter had suffered a head injury. Hollywood actor James Woods said on X he was able to evacuate his Pacific Palisades house but added: \u201cI do not know at this moment if our home is still standing.\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the windstorm is expected to worsen through the morning. A second blaze, dubbed the Eaton Fire, broke out some 30 miles (50 km) inland in Altadena, near Pasadena, and increased in size to 1,000 acres (400 hectares) from 200 acres in a few hours, according to Cal Fire. Almost 100 residents from a nursing home in Pasadena were evacuated, CBS News said. Video showed elderly residents, many in wheelchairs and on gurneys, crowded onto a smoky and windswept parking lot as fire trucks and ambulances attended. Fire officials said a third blaze named the Hurst Fire had started in Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley northwest of Los Angeles, prompting evacuations of some nearby residents. The Hurst fire has grown to 500 acres (202 hectares) from 100 acres (40 hectares) earlier, according to Cal Fire. More than 220,000 homes and businesses in Los Angeles county were without power late on Tuesday, data from PowerOutage.us showed. PALISADES FIRE Witnesses reported a number of homes on fire with flames nearly scorching their cars when people fled the hills of Topanga Canyon as the fire spread from there down to the Pacific Ocean. Local media reported the fire had also spread north, torching homes near Malibu. Parts of Malibu and Santa Monica are under evacuation orders. Multiple burn victims were treated after walking toward Duke\u2019s restaurant in Malibu in the evening, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing a fire official. Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley had earlier told a press conference that more than 25,000 people in 10,000 homes were threatened. Firefighting aircraft scooped water from the sea to drop it on the flames as they engulfed homes. Bulldozers cleared abandoned vehicles from roads so emergency vehicles could pass, television images showed. The fire singed some trees on the grounds of the Getty Villa, a museum loaded with priceless works of art, but the collection remained safe largely because nearby bushes had been trimmed as a preventive measure, the museum said. Before the fire started, the National Weather Service had issued its highest alert for extreme fire conditions for much of Los Angeles County from Tuesday through Thursday. With low humidity and dry vegetation due to a lack of rain, the conditions were \u201cabout as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather,\u201d the service said. Governor Newsom said the state had positioned personnel, firetrucks and aircraft elsewhere in Southern California because of the fire danger to the wider region. California had secured federal grants to suppress all three fires, he said on Wednesday morning. BIDEN TRIP ABANDONED The powerful winds forced a change President Joe Biden\u2019s travel plans, grounding Air Force One in Los Angeles. He had planned to make a short flight inland to the Coachella Valley for a ceremony to create two new national monuments in California. \u201cI have offered any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire,\u201d Biden said in a statement. A federal grant had already been approved to help reimburse the state of California for its fire response, Biden said. Actor Steve Guttenberg told KTLA television that friends of his were impeded from evacuating because others had abandoned their cars in the road. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for everybody to band together and don\u2019t worry about your personal property. Just get out,\u201d Guttenberg said. \u201cGet your loved ones and get out.\u201d Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Wildfire rages in Los Angeles, forcing 30,000 to evacuate",
        "short_description": "January 8, 2025 08:35 am",
        "long_description": "January 8, 2025 08:35 am A rapidly growing wildfire raged across an upscale section of Los Angeles on Tuesday, destroying homes and creating traffic jams as 30,000 people evacuated beneath huge plumes of smoke that covered much of the metropolitan area. At least 2,921 acres (1,182 hectares) of the Pacific Palisades area between the coastal towns of Santa Monica and Malibu had burned, officials said, after they had already warned of extreme fire danger from powerful winds that arrived following extended dry weather. The fire grew rapidly as officials warned the worst wind conditions were expected to come overnight, leading to concerns that more neighborhoods could be forced to flee. Witnesses reported a number homes on fire with flames nearly scorching their cars when people fled the hills of Topanga Canyon, as the fire spread from there down to the Pacific Ocean. \u201cWe feel very blessed at this point that there\u2019s no injuries that are reported,\u201d Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley told a press conference, adding that more than 25,000 people in 10,000 homes were threatened. Firefighters in aircraft scooped water from the sea to drop it on the nearby flames. Flames engulfed homes and bulldozers cleared abandoned vehicles from roads so emergency vehicles could pass, television images showed. As the sun set over Los Angeles, towering orange flames illuminated the hills leading to Topanga Canyon. The fire singed some trees on the grounds of the Getty Villa, a museum loaded with priceless works of art, but the collection remained safe largely because of preventive efforts to trim brush surrounding the buildings, the museum said. It will remain closed at least for the rest of the week. With only one major road leading from the canyon to the coast, and only one coastal highway leading to safety, traffic crawled to a halt, leading people to flee on foot. Cindy Festa, a Pacific Palisades resident, said that as she evacuated out of the canyon, fires were \u201cthis close to the cars,\u201d demonstrating with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cPeople left their cars on Palisades Drive. Burning up the hillside. The palm trees - everything is going,\u201d Festa said from her car. Before the fire started, the National Weather Service had issued its highest alert for extreme fire conditions for much of Los Angeles County from Tuesday through Thursday, predicting wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph (80 to 130 kph). Strong, dry Santa Ana winds originating from inland deserts combined with low humidity and dry vegetation due to a lack of rain. The conditions were \u201cabout as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather,\u201d the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service said on X. Governor Gavin Newsom, who declared a state of emergency, said the state positioned personnel, firetrucks and aircraft elsewhere in Southern California because of the fire danger to the wider region, he added. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019re wrong, but we\u2019re anticipating other fires happening concurrently,\u201d Newsom told the press conference. The winds changed President Joe Biden\u2019s travel plans, grounding Air Force One in Los Angeles. He had planned to make a short flight inland to the Coachella Valley for a ceremony to create two new national monuments in California but the event was rescheduled for a later date at the White House. Pacific Palisades is home to several Hollywood stars. Actor James Woods said on X he was able to evacuate but added, \u201cI do not know at this moment if our home is still standing.\u201d Actor Steve Guttenberg told KTLA television that friends of his were impeded from evacuating because others had abandoned their cars in the road. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for everybody to band together and don\u2019t worry about your personal property. Just get out,\u201d Guttenberg said. \u201cGet your loved ones and get out.\u201d Source: Reuters --Agencies",

As a result, the bus associations have decided to call off their planned island-wide strike. Earlier, the bus associations had decided yesterday (07) to launch an island-wide strike to protest against the police department\u2019s excessive and unnecessary pressure on passenger transport bus operators. In this context, representatives from the bus associations held a discussion with the Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), Priyantha Weerasooriya, at the Police Headquarters this morning (08). Following the discussion with the Acting IGP, it was decided not to proceed with the strike action, the trade unions said.

        "title": "Sri Lanka govt launches strategic initiative for commercialization of R&D",
        "short_description": "January 8, 2025 10:01 pm",
        "long_description": "January 8, 2025 10:01 pm President Anura Kumara Disanayake has emphasized that Sri Lanka can enhance its position in the global market through a robust new product development strategy, which will also create new market opportunities. He made these remarks today (08) during the official launch of the \u201cNational Initiative for R&D Commercialization\u201d held at the Presidential Secretariat. As part of the initiative, the newly developed website nirdc.gov.lk was also launched. This platform aims to facilitate the commercialization of research and development, thereby contributing to sustainable economic growth through the production of value-added goods and services, which will ultimately drive national economic development and social progress, the President Media Division reported. The President pointed out that while grassroots-level innovators do emerge in Sri Lanka, there has been a lack of adequate mechanisms to properly support, nurture, and commercialize their ideas. He stressed the need to create an enabling environment for free and innovative thinking, backed by an efficient system to channel these ideas into productive outcomes. With such a framework in place, Sri Lanka can transform itself into a hub of innovation. Historically, the country has allocated a mere 0.12% of its annual GDP for research and development. Despite Sri Lanka\u2019s abundance of natural resources, there has been limited focus on utilizing research to generate economic benefits. However, with the new government in place, a significant number of local and international investors have shown keen interest in investing in Sri Lanka. The government aims to capitalize on this momentum by efficiently managing investments to spur economic growth without delay, the PMD mentioned. The recently established Ministry of Science and Technology has already begun implementing a long-term, well-structured R&D strategy. The immediate priority will be to convert near-complete or completed research projects into marketable, value-added products and services, providing a quick boost to the economy. To support this effort, the \u201cNational Initiative for R&D Commercialization (NIRDC)\u201d has been established, chaired jointly by the Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, and Senior Advisor to the President, Prof. Gomika Udugamasooriya. The initiative includes a committee comprising experts from diverse fields such as scientific research, industry, economics, law, arts, and indigenous heritage. During the event, President Disanayake highlighted that while human needs remain constant, the methods of fulfilling those needs evolve. He noted that innovation and new product development are key to shaping those new methods. Addressing past shortcomings, the President observed that Sri Lanka\u2019s outdated approach to technology and innovation has hindered its ability to compete in the global market. Despite technological advancements driving a shift in global market trends, Sri Lanka remains trapped in traditional sectors like tea, coconut, and rubber, the PMD said. President Disanayake further underscored that globally leading companies have succeeded by integrating innovation with technology, noting that five out of the world\u2019s top ten companies are technology-based. He pointed out Sri Lanka\u2019s past neglect of technology as a key economic driver, contrasting it with developed countries that prioritized technological advancements and achieved significant economic growth. The President concluded by stating that eradicating poverty is essential not only to eliminate social suffering but also to restore the rights of marginalized communities. He asserted that through innovation, the rural poor can be empowered by ensuring their right to economic participation and access to information, which will ultimately improve their quality of life. Expressing his views, Senior Advisor to the President, Prof. Gomika Udugamasooriya stated: Up to now, research and development (R&D) outcomes in Sri Lanka have not been effectively integrated into the economy. Under this new program, efforts will be directed towards commercializing R&D, enabling economic growth and fostering social development to build a sustainable economy. The event was graced by a distinguished gathering, including Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Ministers Sunil Handunnetti and Wasantha Samarasinghe, Professor Anil Jayantha Fernando and Professor Chrishantha Abeysena, Deputy Ministers Chathuranga Abeysinghe, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Senior Additional Secretary to the President Mr. Russel Apponsu, university vice-chancellors and representatives, heads of state and private research institutions, investors, entrepreneurs, industrialists, and senior executives from banks and financial institutions. --PMD",
