        "long_description": "The army in Sudan says it has captured a key central city, one of its biggest gains yet in an almost two-year-long war against rebel forces. Footage on social media showed people celebrating in the streets as army soldiers entered the city of Wad Madani. The leader of paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged the loss in an audio message. His admission was angry and rambling, attributing the defeat to the army's air superiority and use of Iranian-made drones. But he vowed to continue fighting until victory, even if it took another 20 years. Wad Madani is the capital of the state of Al Jazira, and is 87 miles (140km) south of the country's capital, Khartoum. Wad Madani serves as a strategic crossroads, connecting several states through key supply highways. It is also the closest major town to Khartoum. Sudan has been ravaged by war since April 2023, when fighting broke out between the RSF and the Sudanese army. The RSF continues to control nearly all of Sudan's western Darfur region, as well as significant portions of the country's south. Meanwhile, the army controls the north and east, as well as parts of Khartoum. The war has claimed tens of thousands of lives. And in what the United Nations has called one of the world's \"largest displacement crises\", about nine million people have been forced to flee their homes. The country is also slipping into a famine, with 24.6 million people - about half the population - in urgent need of food aid, experts said. Earlier this month, the US sanctioned the RSF leader after it accused the group of committing genocide. Officials said he was being punished for his role in \"systematic\" atrocities against the Sudanese people during the 20-month conflict.

        "title": "A murder that shook British India and toppled a king",
        "short_description": "It looked like an ordinary murder.",
        "long_description": "It looked like an ordinary murder. One hundred years ago on this day - 12 January 1925 - a group of men attacked a couple on a car ride in a upmarket suburb in Bombay (now Mumbai) in colonial India, shooting the man dead and slashing the woman's face. But the story that unfolded brought global spotlight on the case, while its complexity put the country's then British rulers in a spot of bother, and eventually forced an Indian king to abdicate. Newspapers and magazines described the murder as \"perhaps the most sensational crime committed in British India\", and it became \"the talk of the city\" during the investigation and subsequent trial. The victim, Abdul Kadir Bawla, 25, was an influential textile businessman and the city's youngest municipal official. His female companion, Mumtaz Begum, 22, was a courtesan on the run from the harem of a princely state and had been staying with Bawla for the last few months. On the evening of the murder, Bawla and Mumtaz Begum were in the car with three others, driving in Malabar Hill, an affluent area along the shore of the Arabian Sea. Cars were a rarity in India at the time, and only the rich owned them. Suddenly, another car overtook them. Before they could react, it collided with theirs, forcing them to stop, according to intelligence and newspaper reports. The attackers showered expletives on Bawla and shouted \"get the lady out\", Mumtaz Begum later told the Bombay High Court. They then shot Bawla, who died a few hours later. A group of British soldiers, who had inadvertently taken a wrong turn on their way back from a golf game, heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene. They managed to catch one of the culprits, but one officer suffered gunshot wounds when an attacker opened fire at them. Before fleeing, the remaining attackers made two attempts to snatch the injured Mumtaz Begum from the British officers, who were trying to rush her to the hospital. The newspapers suggested that attackers' aim was likely abducting Mumtaz Begum, as Bawla - whom she had met while performing in Mumbai a few months earlier and had been living with since - had earlier received several threats for sheltering her. The Illustrated Weekly of India promised readers exclusive photographs of Mumtaz Begum, while the police planned to issue a daily bulletin to the press, Marathi newspaper Navakal reported. Even Bollywood found the case compelling enough to adapt it into a silent murder thriller within months. \"The case went beyond the usual murder mystery as it involved a rich and young tycoon, a slighted king, and a beautiful woman,\" says Dhaval Kulkarni, author of The Bawla Murder Case: Love, Lust and Crime in Colonial India. The attackers' footprints, as speculated in the media, led investigators to the influential princely state of Indore, which was a British ally. Mumtaz Begum, a Muslim, had lived in the harem of its Hindu king, Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III. Mumtaz Begum was famed for her beauty. \"In her own class, it was said, Mumtaz was without a peer,\" KL Gauba wrote in his 1945 book, Famous Trials for Love and Murder. But the Maharaja's (king's) attempts to control her - preventing her from seeing her family alone and keeping her under constant surveillance - soured their relationship, says Kulkarni. \"I was kept under surveillance. I was allowed to see visitors and my relations but somebody always accompanied me,\" Mumtaz Begum testified in the court. In Indore, she gave birth to a baby girl, who died soon after. \"After my child was born, I was unwilling to stay at Indore. I was unwilling because the nurses killed the female child that was born,\" Mumtaz Begum told the court. Within months, she escaped to the northern Indian city of Amritsar, her mother's place of birth, but troubles followed. She was watched there too. Mumtaz Begum's stepfather told the court that the Maharaja wept and begged her to return. But she refused and moved to Bombay, where the surveillance continued. The trial confirmed what media had speculated following the murder: representatives of the Maharaja had indeed threatened Bawla with dire consequences if he continued to shelter Mumtaz Begum, but he had ignored the warnings. Following a lead given by Shafi Ahmed, the only attacker captured at the scene, the Bombay police arrested seven men from Indore. The investigation revealed links to the Maharaja that were hard to ignore. Most of the arrested men were employed by the Indore princely state, had applied for leave around the same time and were in Bombay at the time of the crime. The murder put the British government in a tough spot. Though it happened in Bombay, the investigation clearly showed the plot was planned in Indore, which had strong ties to the British. Terming it \"the most awkward affair\" for the British government, The New Statesman wrote that if it were a minor state, \"there would be no particular cause for anxiety\". \"But Indore has been a powerful feudatory of the Raj,\" it said. The British government initially tried to keep mum about the murder's Indore connection in public. But in private, it discussed the issue with much alarm, communication between the governments of Bombay and British India shows. Bombay police commissioner Patrick Kelly told the British government that all evidence \"points at present to a conspiracy hatched in Indore or by instigation from Indore to abduct Mumtaj [sic] through hired desperadoes\". The government faced pressure from different sides. Bawla's community of wealthy Memons, a Muslim community with roots in modern-day Gujarat, raised the issue with the government. His fellow municipal officials mourned his death, saying, \"there surely must be something more behind the scene\". Indian lawmakers demanded answers in the upper house of British India's legislature and the case was even discussed in the British House of Commons. Rohidas Narayan Dusar, a former police officer, writes in his book on the murder that the investigators were under pressure to go slow, but that then police commissioner Kelly threatened to resign. The case drew top lawyers for both the defence and the prosecution when it reached the Bombay High Court. One of them was Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who would later become the founding father of Pakistan after India's partition in 1947. Jinnah defended Anandrao Gangaram Phanse, one of the accused and a top general with the Indore army. Jinnah managed to save his client from the death penalty. The court sentenced three men to death and three to life imprisonment, but it stopped short of holding the Maharaja accountable. Justice LC Crump, who led the trial, noted, however, that \"there were persons behind them [assailants] whom we cannot precisely indicate\". \"But where an attempt is made to kidnap a woman, who was for 10 years the mistress of the Maharaja of Indore, it is not in the least unreasonable to look to Indore as the quarter from which this attack may have emanated,\" the judge remarked. The case's prominence meant the British government had to act quickly against the Maharaja. They gave him a choice: face a commission of inquiry or abdicate, according to documents presented to parliament in India. The Maharaja chose to quit. \"I abdicate my throne in favour of my son on the understanding that no further inquiry into my alleged connection with the Malabar Hill Tragedy will be made,\" he wrote to the British government. After abdicating, the Maharaja stirred more controversy by insisting on marrying an American woman against the will of his family and community. Eventually, she converted to Hinduism and they wed, according to a British home department report. Meanwhile, Mumtaz Begum received offers from Hollywood and later moved to the US to try her luck there. She faded into obscurity after that. The Hindu festival of Kumbh Mela, described as humanity's biggest gathering, begins in India's Prayagraj. The government places an export bar on a 2,000-year old artefact which was sold to a foreign buyer. The service will be held in Hull on Sunday 26 January. Historians are hoping to shine a light on the rich history of an ancient burial ground in Newcastle.

        "title": "Fact-checking criticism of California Democrats over fires",
        "short_description": "With fires still burning in Los Angeles after several days, some have been accusing politicians of mismanaging resources and making the fires worse.",
        "long_description": "With fires still burning in Los Angeles after several days, some have been accusing politicians of mismanaging resources and making the fires worse. President-elect Donald Trump has pointed a finger squarely at California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who he said is responsible for LA's struggling water supply. A lack of water for firefighter's hoses has been cited as one of the reasons the fires have burned so long. Meanwhile, others have blamed LA Mayor Karen Bass for cutting the city's fire department budget. BBC Verify looked into the facts behind the political fallout. In a social media post on Saturday evening, Trump blamed California's leaders for the current situation. \"The fires are still raging in LA. The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out. Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"They just can't put out the fires,\" he added. \"What's wrong with them?\" Earlier in the week, he criticised Governor Newsom for refusing to sign the \"water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water\" to put out the fires. But the specific declaration he mentions doesn't appear to exist. We've also searched for this document and been unable to find it. Newsom has previously opposed efforts to redirect more water to southern California. This includes a 2020 presidential memorandum in which Trump sought to divert water away from Northern California to farmland further south. Newsom opposed this at the time, saying he wanted to protect \"highly imperilled fish species close to extinction\". That is what Trump is referencing in his post blaming Newsom for the response to the wildfires, where he says the governor \"wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish\", Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt has confirmed. In an interview with Pod Save America on Saturday, Newsom said Trump's statements were \"made up\" and \"delusional\". California's attorney general ultimately blocked the measure to redirect water to the south, citing potential harm to endangered species and saying that it was not scientifically justified. Jeffrey Mount, senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California's Water Policy Center, said: \"The federal government does not deliver water from northern California to southern California. \"While efforts to save Delta smelt, along with salmon and steelhead trout, do reduce the amount of water that is moved from northern California by the state at certain times, it has no bearing on the current availability of water for fire-fighting.\" Although southern California is currently experiencing a drought, data shows its reservoirs are almost all currently above the historic average for this time of the year. None are at significantly low levels. However, one large reservoir in Pacific Palisades, the Santa Ynez Reservoir, was closed for maintenance and empty when the fire broke out. Officials from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) said that if the Santa Ynez Reservoir had been operational, it might have increased the supply of water, but that it's unclear what the ultimate effect might have been. On Friday, Newsom confirmed Trump's claim that there had been no water for some fire hydrants, which hampered the emergency response. Firefighters in Los Angeles have told the BBC they experienced shortages. Newsom called for an independent investigation into the loss of water pressure to hydrants and \"the reported unavailability of water supplies from the Santa Ynez Reservoir\". In a letter addressed to the heads of the LA Department of Water and Power and LA County Public Works, Newsom said that reports of inadequate water supplies were \"deeply troubling\" . \"Losing supplies from fire hydrants likely impaired the effort to protect some homes and evacuation corridors,\" he wrote. \"We need answers to how that happened,\" he continued, adding that he expects the agencies to \"fully and transparently\" share information and records for the state's probe. Adam Van Gerpen, a captain with the Los Angeles fire department, confirmed to the BBC that his crew, which has been tackling the Pacific Palisades blaze, and other crews battling other wildfires, ran out of water, forcing them to \"improvise\". As of 08:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on Sunday, Cal Fire data showed firefighters had fully contained one of the remaining fires, the Kenneth fire, and made significant progress with another, known as the Hurst fire. However, the containment of the largest fire in Palisades remained at 11%, while the Eaton fire was 27% contained. LA Mayor Karen Bass has faced criticism over cuts to the city's fire department budget. For the latest financial year, the LA Fire Department (LAFD) budget was reduced by $17.6m (\u00a314.3m). LA Fire Chief Kristin Crowley told CNN that the budget cut had \"severely\" affected the department's ability to respond to the disaster. She said the department was already under-staffed and the elimination of civilian positions, like mechanics, had meant that 100 fire apparatuses were out of service. Mayor Bass responded to the criticism, saying: \"There were no reductions that were made that would have impacted the situation that we were dealing with over the last couple of days.\" According to the LA Times, after the 2024-25 budget was passed, the city council approved $53m in pay raises for firefighters and $58m for new kit, such as firetrucks. Once that funding is taken into account, the fire department's operating budget technically grew this year, according to the newspaper. The LAFD has an overall budget of approaching $1bn, and it isn't the only department responding to the fires. For example, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Los Angeles County Fire Department are part of the relief efforts, along with the federal government.

        "long_description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is willing to hand over the two captured North Korean soldiers back to Pyongyang in exchange for Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russia. \"For those North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, there may be other options available,\" Zelensky said on X. Those who want \"to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about this war in Korean will be given that opportunity\", he added. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said one of the two soldiers told officials he thought he was going to Russia for \"training\", rather than to fight. He was found with a Russian military ID card issued in the name of another person. The other soldier had no documents. SBU said the two men, who were taken prisoner on 9 Jan, are in Kyiv and receiving medical care. They only speak Korean and are being questioned with the assistance of South Korea's National Intelligence Service, SBU said. Russia has not denied using North Korean troops in its war against Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin said in October that it was his country's \"sovereign decision\" whether or not to deploy such troops. On Saturday, Zelensky posted photographs of the two captured soldiers, showing one of them with his head and chin in bandage, while the other had both his hands fully wrapped up. Zelensky also shared a photo of a red Russian military ID card that gives the place of birth as Turan, in the Russian republic of Tuva, which shares a border with Mongolia. SBU said that the soldier found with the ID card told interrogators he had been issued the document during the autumn of 2024, in Russia. According to SBU, he also said that some of North Korea's combat units had undergone a one-week training at the time. \"It is noteworthy that the prisoner...emphasises that he was allegedly going for training, not to fight a war against Ukraine,\" the SBU statement said. Zelensky's office said in a statement on Saturday that the Russians \"are trying to hide the fact that these are soldiers from North Korea by giving them documents claiming they are from Tuva or other territories under Moscow's control\". The intelligence service reported that the soldier carrying the ID card said he was born in 2005 and had been serving North Korea as a rifleman since 2021. The second prisoner is reported to have given some of his answers in writing because he had an injured jaw, according to SBU. SBU said it believed he was born in 1999 and had been serving North Korea as a scout sniper since 2016. The Geneva Convention states that the questioning of prisoners should be carried out in a language they understand and prisoners must be protected against public curiosity. BBC News and other international media have not yet verified Ukraine's account of the prisoners and their capture. Ukraine and South Korea reported late last year that North Korea had sent at least 10,000 troops to Russia. South Korea's National Intelligence Service said on Monday that more than 300 North Korean soldiers have died while fighting for Russia, and at least 2,700 of them have been wounded. In December, South Korea's intelligence agency reported that a North Korean soldier believed to have been the first to be captured while supporting Russia's war in Ukraine had died after being taken alive by Ukrainian forces. Zelensky said on Sunday \"there should be no doubt left that the Russian army is dependent on military assistance from North Korea\". President Zelensky says the two men are receiving \"necessary medical assistance\". The former US president halted a US-North Korea showdown, but was also accused of going rogue. The actions are aimed at cutting off revenue Moscow is using to fund its war in Ukraine. The US president-elect has said previously that he wants to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The vehicles will be driven to Krakow to help refugees and those injured in Ukraine. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

        "title": "Our remote isle celebrates New Year on 13 January",
        "short_description": "A remote Shetland island is celebrating its traditional New Year's Day - two weeks after other parts of the world.",
        "long_description": "A remote Shetland island is celebrating its traditional New Year's Day - two weeks after other parts of the world. Foula - which is home to less than 40 people - never fully adopted the modern Gregorian calendar, preferring instead to follow some of the traditions of the Julian calendar. So this sees islanders celebrate Christmas on 6 January rather than 25 December, and New Year's Day on 13 January. \"It is how we have always done it,\" one islander told BBC Scotland News. More than four centuries ago, Pope Gregory XIII designed the calendar used today to replace the Julian calendar, which had miscalculated the number of days it takes for the Earth to revolve around the sun. Foula residents do not follow the Julian calendar as a strict daily rule due to the practicalities of island life, as they have to fit in with things such as plane and ferry timetables. However Christmas Day and New Year's Day are different. Foula is about 16 miles from the Shetland mainland and lays claim to being Britain's most remote inhabited island. It is less than five miles long, and is powered by wind turbines, hydro energy and solar panels, with generators for back-up. It is served by a ferry which runs between the island and Shetland, and there are also regular flights from Tingwall Airport, just outside Lerwick, to the island. The island was one of the last places in Shetland where the old Norn language, a relic of Norse times, was spoken. The most recent population headcount was 36. Like many of those islanders, Robert Smith, 27, has a number of roles. These include crewing the ferry, working at the water treatment plant, doing tours, and delivering mail if needed. \"We do anything and everything,\" he said. \"You have got to keep busy. Everyone chips in.\" He spent some of his life on mainland Shetland during his education, and has experienced the \"best of both worlds\" by getting to celebrate two Christmas days and two New Year days in a single 12-month period. On Foula's calendar differences, he said: \"I think growing up it felt unique. \"But our New Year has similarities with first-footing. You go round houses with a drink, stay a while, and catch up. Then maybe home for dinner and then somewhere for a party into the small hours. \"In Foula it's family-focussed, it's more intimate, and we are always playing music together. It's something the island is known for. It's a good bonding thing. \"It is how we have always done it.\" He started off on the guitar, then moved onto the mandolin, and is now trying to learn the fiddle, all \"just for enjoyment\". He added: \"Christmases are similar, most people stay at home in the morning for presents and spending time together. \"In the past there were maybe different traditions that have slipped away - the men would go out shooting birds to cook.\" Population levels can fluctuate but Mr Smith described things as being in a healthy place at the moment. \"Most small islands can be older people but we are doing good,\" he said. \"We have got a lot of children and young people. \"I think Foula has a very relaxed and independent feel, there is no-one breathing down your neck.\" For New Year's Day he said he would follow in the traditions he had learned from his mother and grandmother - doing a bit of something you want to do well in for the rest of the year. This could perhaps include crofting work, or gardening, or fishing. \"It's a token effort to bring good fortune,\" he said. \"I have a croft house I am trying to do up, so I might do some plastering.\" Another islander, who preferred not to be named, said: \"Yule Day on the 6th works in a fairly similar way to the 25th for most folk. \"The things that are unique are we make an effort to go round every house for music and singing, and a big party. \"It feels less commercialised, and rooted in traditions. It's important to maintain these old traditions.\" Islanders were lucky enough to have a \"kind of\" white Christmas this year amid a thaw, he said, with some snow still on the hills. \"And New Year is not Hogmanay like the rest of the country, with the 13th being the equivalent of the 1st,\" he explained. \"Everything is the same as Yule Day, with a big party at the end of the evening.\" The crofter echoed: \"We try to do a little bit of everything for the year ahead, a small amount of each job you are involved in. \"And I would go and collect some driftwood from the shore, which is a tradition, for good luck.\" Data from Hitched shows hundreds are choosing off-season nuptials with some based around Christmas. After this year's fireworks event fell victim to the weather, organisers rule out using drones. Residents in a street where every house is lit-up for Christmas start planning their next showstoppers. Dedicated yarnbombers enter the record books by topping 102 post boxes with knitted creations. Crews are disposing of trees in exchange for a donation to the Fire Fighter charity. Copyright 2025 BBC.
