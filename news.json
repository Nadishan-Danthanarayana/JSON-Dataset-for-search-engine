        "long_description": "Australia will head to the polls for a federal election on 3 May, in what is predicted to be a tight race. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, whose Labor Party will be defending a small majority, announced the date from Parliament House on Friday. Opinion polls predict a slim margin between the country's two major parties, and the possibility either will have to work with independent MPs or minor parties - which combined won a record share of the vote at the last election - to form the next government. The campaign is expected to be dominated by cost-of-living issues, and Labor is fighting to avoid becoming the first single-term government to lose an election in almost a century. In a press conference on Friday morning, Albanese reiterated his pledge to address the cost of living - having already unveiled plans to provide more free healthcare, cut student debt and deliver small tax cuts. He argued that electing his rival Peter Dutton would be a step backwards for the country. \"It was always going to take more than three years to clean up 10 years of mess,\" he said, referring to the previous coalition government he defeated at the last election in 2022. Never has voters' choice been more important, or more clear, he said: \"This election is a choice between Labor's plan to keep building or Peter Dutton's promise to cut.\" Albanese said his campaign would be about \"hope and optimism,\" while Dutton's would be \"all about fear\". The leader of the Liberal-National coalition, however, has said the country cannot afford three more years of a Labor government. \"The question Australians need to ask is: Is our country better off today than three years ago?\" Dutton said at a press conference after the election was called. \"Because of Labor's bad decisions, Australians are doing it tough and they need help.\" He argued his party would \"get Australia back on track\" by reining in \"wasteful spending\", slimming down the public service, cutting immigration, and making fuel and energy cheaper. The Greens, which last election won a record number of seats, said Australians should vote for them to keep Labor accountable on issues like the environment and housing. \"Minority government is coming. And with the major parties' offering about as attractive as a dead fish, you can see why,\" leader Adam Bandt said. The affordability of housing and groceries is at the top of voters' minds, as well as access to healthcare, though concern about managing record immigration and reducing crime is increasing significantly. Climate action - the feature of the last election - remains important to many Australians too. Politics in Australia - where voting is compulsory for adults - is traditionally dominated by Labor and the Liberal-National coalition. Either party needs to win at least 76 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - where the prime minister sits - to form a majority government. One of the country's longest serving politicians, Albanese took power after long period of political instability, in which the country changed leader six times in only eight years. He promised unity and integrity and - after a campaign marked by anger over Australia's emissions reductions efforts - vowed to \"end the climate wars\". Albanese's government enshrined into law a boosted emissions cut target, and introduced a mechanism that acts as a carbon cap for the country's biggest emitters - though experts say more ambition is needed. However, Albanese's key goal of achieving constitutional recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and establishing a parliamentary advisory body for them, failed at a referendum in 2023. And he has come under pressure over global economic conditions which have exacerbated cost-of-living pain in Australia - and played a part in the downfall of several incumbent governments around the world in the past year. Last year, he came under fire after it emerged that he had bought a A$4.3m ($2.9m, \u00a32.2m) cliff-top home amid a national housing crisis. Australians have not ousted a government from Canberra after only a single term since 1931. Dutton - who was a police officer in Queensland before he was elected - has more than 20 years in parliament under his belt, many of them spent as a senior minister handling key portfolios like health, immigration, defence and home affairs. He built a reputation as a hard-line conservative best known for overseeing Australia's controversial policies on asylum seekers, and his role in the downfall of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. He has styled himself as a cultural warrior - opposing same sex marriage, diversity and inclusion initiatives and the Voice to Parliament referendum - but has in recent times tried to shake his tough public persona, which he says doesn't accurately reflect who he is.

        "title": "Can Vietnam golf its way out of new Trump tariffs?",
        "short_description": "Countries around the world are braced for Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day in America!!!\" next week.",
        "long_description": "Countries around the world are braced for Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day in America!!!\" next week. The US president's deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners will come just days after he hit foreign carmakers with 25% import taxes. Vietnam could be particularly vulnerable to Trump's latest salvo of levies. It has a large trade deficit with the US and has been a beneficiary of firms moving factories out of China to avoid measures announced during his first term in office. While some countries have hit back at Washington, Vietnam's Prime Minister, Pham Minh Chinh, has suggested that he may take a more diplomatic approach. Speaking in January, he said he was willing to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and \"golf all day long\" if it benefits his country, drawing laughter in the room. And that idea may not too far-fetched. The Trump Organization is planning to invest billions of dollars in golf courses, hotels and real estate in Vietnam, according to the Reuters news agency. The first project will reportedly be a residential complex with three 18-hole golf courses, which will break ground in May. The BBC has contacted the company and its Vietnamese partner for comment. But could golf diplomacy really work? Trump has previously said Vietnam was \"worse than China\" and \"almost the single worst abuser of anybody\". But he has not yet specifically targeted Vietnam with tariffs, even though it has the third largest trade deficit with the US, after China and Mexico. Analysts say Vietnam is doing well at engaging with Washington - but its efforts may still not be enough to avoid most of Trump's tariff plans. \"The Vietnam PM seems to be taking a page from the book of [former Japanese PM] Shinzo Abe, who built a close personal relationship with Trump over their shared love of golf,\" said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator. \"I would not however expect any special treatment of Vietnam from a policy point of view. Personal relationships are important to Trump, but in this case, I believe his desire to appear tough on trade will win out.\" Vietnam has said it doesn't plan to \"restrict trade\" with the US, although it currently taxes some imports from there. The government said this week that it will allow SpaceX, which is owned by close Trump ally Elon Musk, to operate its Starlink satellite internet service in the country on a trial basis. Some analysts see this as one of the measures Vietnam has taken to avoid being hit with US tariffs. Hanoi also said it will lower tariffs on several US imports, including energy and cars, a move aimed at \"improving trade balances\". It came less than two weeks after Vietnamese and US companies signed more than $4bn (\u00a35.4bn) in deals, in areas including oil and gas exploration. Steve Norris from the consultancy Control Risks said \"Vietnam is being careful to avoid any moves which would signal any non-cooperation on trade issues\". This strategy is in line with its foreign policy approach - known as \"bamboo diplomacy\". Like shoots of plants that sway with the wind, Vietnam hopes to be adaptable to foreign pressures. \"If the US were to increase pressure on Vietnam, the government might respond with offers to facilitate investments in the hospitality and casino industries, undertake advanced machinery purchases, and \u2013 capturing the moment \u2013 consider access to Vietnam's rare earth minerals,\" Mr Norris said. One big factor working against Vietnam is concerns about China's influence. Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term. In 2018, he hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam. This has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure. Former US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said Vietnam has emerged as a \"destination for major Chinese investment\". While the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data. Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year. \"These are huge red flags for Trump. My expectation is that Vietnam will at some point be hit hard by tariffs,\" Mr Olson said. However, tariffs on Vietnam could impact US businesses such as tech firms Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike, which have moved production lines from China to Vietnam. A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed. The US president believes the levies will boost his country's economy by encouraging more businesses to make goods in the US and bring in billions of dollars of taxes. But many economists have warned that it could force up prices for American consumers and negatively impact global trade. Washington is also concerned about so-called \"trans-shipments\" - Chinese goods passing through Vietnam on their way to other countries. US officials have been \"quietly stressing to Vietnam that it must reduce its trade surplus over time and combat the trans-shipment of Chinese goods through the country,\" Mr Norris said. Vietnam's prime minister has said he is confident that his administration can \"handle the relationship with the US\". Now that the South East Asian nation has cut some tariffs on US goods they may be more attractive to Vietnamese consumers, increasing America's share of trade with the country. And then there is golf - playing a game with Trump had worked for the late Japanese leader Shinzo Abe. Abe and Trump established a friendship, which included many golf games over several years. The friendship arguably helped Abe secure tariff exemptions for Japan's critical car industry at the time. For now, it is unclear if Vietnam would really give golf diplomacy a swing. The real test will come next week, when a new slate of Trump's taxes are set to take effect. Manufacturers are expected to ask for state support ahead of next week's 25% tariff on exports. Shenzhen-based Tencent, which owns the popular messaging app WeChat, will hold about a quarter of a new subsidiary. The music icon was shot and killed by the founder of her fan club, who has been denied her first attempt at parole in Texas. The order says that \"divisive narratives\" must be purged from the US museums and research centres. The BBC asked Canadian voters in Toronto how they would approach Donald Trump if they were prime minister. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

The Reform leader makes the comments on the role of women in the workplace at an event in Westminster. Global uncertainty over Trump's tariffs could derail the chancellor's plans, economists warn. The chancellor has faced criticism for accepting free tickets to watch Sabrina Carpenter from a box. Some employers and landlords are reluctant to hire or rent to Ukrainians because their visas are due to expire. The Reform leader makes the comments on the role of women in the workplace at an event in Westminster. The government will not get close to the extra homes needed to hit its housing in England, figures say. Manufacturers are expected to ask for state support ahead of next week's 25% tariff on exports. Global uncertainty over Trump's tariffs could derail the chancellor's plans, economists warn. The chancellor is on track to meet her own fiscal rules, so why is there talk of tax rises in the autumn? About 31% of children are living in relative poverty after housing costs, government figures show. Watch: Don't call civil servants 'pen-pushers', says Sue Gray The UK is in \"intense negotiations\" with the US over tariff plans, the prime minister says. Darren Jones apologises for the \"tactless\" comments after critics branded them \"offensive\" and \"patronising\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled her plans for the UK economy in the House of Commons. The IFS warning comes as the chancellor says the UK is in discussions with the US over Donald Trump's new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts. The strategy from the UK government has been to wrangle in private and say as little as possible in public, our political editor writes. Henry Zeffman explains what you need to know about the Spring Statement. The UK's economic prospects are better than expected, but the forecasts are precarious and could easily be derailed.

        "short_description": "In Murmansk, the largest city north of the Arctic circle, President Vladimir Putin vowed to \"strengthen Russia's global leadership in the Arctic\", while warning that \"geopolitical competition in the region\" was intensifying.",
        "long_description": "In Murmansk, the largest city north of the Arctic circle, President Vladimir Putin vowed to \"strengthen Russia's global leadership in the Arctic\", while warning that \"geopolitical competition in the region\" was intensifying. The first example he gave was Donald Trump's idea to acquire Greenland. But from the Kremlin leader there was no criticism of his US counterpart. And that's telling, as the White House and the Kremlin try to rebuild relations. \"In short, America's plans in relation to Greenland are serious,\" President Putin said in an address to Russia's Arctic Forum in Murmansk. \"These plans have deep historical roots. And it's clear that the US will continue to systematically pursue its geo-strategic, military-political and economic interests in the \u0410rctic. \"As for Greenland this is a matter for two specific countries. It has nothing to do with us.\" So said the president who had launched a full-scale invasion of a sovereign neighbouring country and claims to have annexed whole swathes of Ukraine. When Joe Biden was in the White House, Moscow and Washington were vocal in their criticism of one another. How things have changed. Today Russia is promoting the idea of economic cooperation with the United States in an Arctic region packed with natural resources. \"We are open to considering different investment opportunities that we can do jointly with the US, in certain sectors approved by the Russian government,\" says Kirill Dmitriev, President Putin's envoy for foreign investment and economic cooperation. Mr Dmitriev, who is also chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, has already been in talks with US officials. \"We are open for investment cooperation in the Arctic. That could be in logistics, or other areas beneficial to Russia and to the US,\" Mr Dmitriev adds. \"But before deals can be done the war in Ukraine needs to end,\" I suggest. \"Many people in the West accuse Russia of dragging its feet, showing no compromise or concessions, and just laying down conditions.\" \"I am focused on economics and investments, so I don't comment on political issues,\" Mr Dmitriev responds. \"The only thing I can say is we have a very good dialogue, and I think it's very important that the US is trying to understand Russia's position.\" Moscow seems confident that it can woo Washington with promises of lucrative deals in the Arctic and across Russia. That confidence is understandable considering how senior US officials have been repeating Kremlin talking points about the war in Ukraine and about Europe. In a recent interview with former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff appeared to accept the results of Moscow-organised referenda that were held in Ukrainian territories seized and occupied by Russia. These votes that have not been recognised by the international community. In the words of one recent Russian newspaper headline: \"US and Russian officials are now talking the same language.\" Are the Russian authorities at all surprised by the sea change in America's Russia policy? \"[In America] there are two parties that compete with one another,\" says Nikolai Patrushev, former head of Russia's FSB domestic security service. Mr Patrushev, who is now an aide to President Putin, is one of the most powerful figures in Russia. While on the side lines of the Arctic Forum he tells me: \"When the Democrats were in power, they took one view. The Republicans have another. \"It doesn't mean that they agree with Russia's standpoint. Only that they have their own, which they promote, and we can cooperate with them.\" I ask Mr Patrushev: \"Do you have a sense that a new world order is being forged?\". \"We used to have a system where two powers dominated in the world. Then it was just one. Now we're building a multi-polar world. But with its own peculiarities,\" says Mr Patrushev. In the centre of Murmansk, a giant inflatable whale has taken over one of the city's squares. Attached to wires, it's bobbing over a sea of silver balloons designed to look like waves. The balloons are dancing in the wind beneath the blow-up beast. It's a giant installation. But then Russia has enormous ambitions, both for the Arctic and for the country's relations with America. The whale is attracting a great deal of interest with lots of families posing for photos. It's an opportunity to ask Russians whether they support the idea of economic cooperation with America in the Arctic and whether they're surprised when Washington appears to take Moscow's side? Elina isn't. \"Russia is strong,\" she says. \"You should always back the strong ones and go along with them.\" \"We need to develop the Arctic,\" Olga tells me. \"Cooperation with 'friendly countries' is a good thing.\" \"And do you see America as a 'friendly country'?\" I ask. \"You know what? I can't decide.\" replies Olga. Meanwhile presidential envoy Mr Dmitriev is singing the praises of one particular American - Elon Musk \u2013 and counting on cooperation. \"We believe Elon Musk is a great visionary, a great leader and a very successful person,\" Mr Dmitriev tells me. \"Russia has a lot to offer for a mission to Mars because we have some nuclear technologies which can be applicable. \"There are some video conferences we believe will be upcoming with, let's say, the Musk team.\" Now is not the time for pulling back or weakening sanctions, the UK PM says at Paris summit. Another 39 people were rescued after the vessel sank in the Red Sea on Thursday morning. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shares this thoughts on Europe's support and his country's resilience. The Ukrainian president was answering questions from a panel of European journalists in Paris. The law will allow Polish authorities to temporarily spend asylum rights at the border with Belarus.

        "short_description": "President Donald Trump has pulled the nomination of New York Rep Elise Stefanik to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations.",
        "long_description": "President Donald Trump has pulled the nomination of New York Rep Elise Stefanik to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations. Announcing his decision in a post on social media, Trump said it was essential that Stefanik retain her seat in the House of Representatives to protect Republicans' razor-thin majority. \"I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations.\" Calling her one of his biggest allies, the president said Stefanik would rejoin the House leadership team. In preparation for the UN role, she had forfeited her position as the third most senior member, the House Republican Conference chairperson. Speaker Mike Johnson praised her in statement. \"There is no doubt she would have served with distinction as our ambassador to the United Nations, but we are grateful for her willingness to sacrifice that position and remain in Congress to help us save the country.\" Stefanik, a onetime Trump critic turned MAGA darling, was the president's first cabinet pick. She was expected to sail through Senate confirmation, but the vote on her nomination was delayed because her support was needed in the House to pass Republican-backed legislation. Her confirmation was supposed to move to a vote after a pair of special election races in Florida on 1 April. Former Rep Mike Waltz - the current national security advisor - is one of the congressmen to leave the two Republican-safe seats empty. But discussions were held at the White House on Thursday about whether Stefanik should remain in Congress, given the president's agenda and the need to protect the narrow 218-213 Republican majority in the House. Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the decision showed Republicans were in panic mode, and Trump feared losing a district he won by 21 points in November 2024. \"He withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador because the extremists are afraid they will lose the special election to replace her. The Republican agenda is extremely unpopular, they are crashing the economy in real time and House Republicans are running scared,\" Jeffries said. Stefanik will continue to represent her solidly Republican upstate New York district, where she recently held a farewell tour in preparation for the UN role. She also attended a White House cabinet meeting last month. During her confirmation hearing, Stefanik said she would make Trump's agenda her own, particularly his \"peace through strength\" approach to US foreign policy. As a member of Congress, she has been one of the international body's toughest critics and a staunch defender of Israel. She has previously called for the US to cut funding to the UN, describing it as a \"cesspool of anti-Semitism\" and a \"corrupt, defunct and paralyzed institution\". The Trump administration has already ordered a review of US funding to the UN's regular budget and sweeping cuts to foreign aid that has dramatically impacted the work and staff of several UN agencies. The organization is seriously examining what the effects of further cuts or delayed payments would mean. It is facing a cash crunch and has moved with urgency to reduce planned spending by up to 20% and to impose a hiring freeze. The White House has not announced who the president might nominate to serve as ambassador to the UN next. One diplomat told the BBC it would be good to have a US ambassador there soon so they can better engage with the Trump administration. Stefanik's nomination is the fourth nominee who did not make it through a confirmation process. Former congressman Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, withdrew after Trump nominated him to serve as attorney general. Chad Chronister withdrew from leading the Drug Enforcement Administration, and David Weldon withdrew from serving as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The order says that \"divisive narratives\" must be purged from the US museums and research centres. How much attention did you pay to what has been going on in the world over the past seven days? Greenland is giving the cold shoulder to JD Vance and his wife, amid Trump's pledge to take control of the island.

        "short_description": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US has revoked at least 300 foreign students' visas as part of President Donald Trump's effort to clamp down on pro-Palestinian protesters on university campuses.",
        "long_description": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US has revoked at least 300 foreign students' visas as part of President Donald Trump's effort to clamp down on pro-Palestinian protesters on university campuses. \"Maybe more than 300 at this point,\" he said while speaking to reporters on a visit to Guyana. \"We do it every day, every time I find one of these lunatics.\" Rubio was asked to confirm how many student visas the administration had revoked in its crackdown on rhetoric at universities that it considers anti-Israeli. The remarks follow immigration officials detention of a doctoral Turkish student attending Tufts University - an arrest the secretary defended. A video of the student, Rumeysa Ozturk, being taken away by masked, plain-clothes officers to an unmarked car outside Boston, Massachusetts, has gone viral and sparked protests online. Ms Ozturk is a Fullbright Scholar on an F-1 student visa and is in a doctoral program for Child Study and Human Development at Tufts. Rubio was asked on Thursday why the Turkish student's visa was revoked. \"Here's why: I've said it everywhere, and I'll say it again,\" Rubio said. \"If you apply for a student visa to come to the United States and you say you're coming not just to study, but to participate in movements that vandalize universities, harass students, take over buildings, and cause chaos, we're not giving you that visa.\" It is currently unclear whether Ms Ozturk has been charged with anything. Rubio did not provide any of the specific allegations against the 30-year-old, who has participated in pro-Palestinian protests. The Tufts student also co-wrote an opinion piece in the student newspaper last year that called for her university to divest from companies with ties to Israel and acknowledge \"Palestinian genocide\". \"Based on patterns we are seeing across the country, her exercising her free speech rights appears to have played a role in her detention,\" Mahsa Khanbabai, Ms Ozturk's lawyer, told Reuters. This arrest is the latest in a string of actions taken against international students in the US who have expressed support for Palestinians. Trump officials have said they are making use of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the State Department to deport non-citizens who are \"adversarial to the foreign policy and national security interests\" of the US. The arrests are a part of Trump's pledge to combat what the administration has classified as antisemitism, which was written into an executive order in January. Since then, the White House has also revoked $400m (\u00a3308m) in Columbia funding over allegations the university failed to combat antisemitism on its campus, and threatened to do the same to other universities. One of the highest profile arrests involves Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist, who remains in a Louisiana detention facility without charges. Ms Ozturk was also taken to a detention centre in Louisiana. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Massachusetts ordered that Ms Ozturk be detained in Massachusetts, but federal records show she is still being held in Louisiana. The government has been ordered to provide more information on Ms Ozturk's arrest by Friday. US Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said earlier this week that Ms Ozturk \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans\". Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the arrest \"the latest in an alarming pattern to stifle civil liberties\". \"The Trump administration is targeting students with legal status and ripping people out of their communities without due process. This is an attack on our Constitution and basic freedoms - and we will push back,\" she said in a statement. On Wednesday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to halt its efforts to deport and arrest another student, Yunseo Chung of Columbia University. The 21-year-old is a legal permanent resident who moved to the US from South Korea as a child. On Thursday, Rubio said the US gave students visa to earn a degree and \"not become a social activist tearing up our campuses\". \"If you lie, get the visa, and then engage in that kind of behaviour once you're here, we're going to revoke it,\" he said. The order says that \"divisive narratives\" must be purged from the US museums and research centres. How much attention did you pay to what has been going on in the world over the past seven days?

Between 1930 and 1956, there where six strong quakes of 7.0 magnitude near the Sagaing Fault, which runs through the centre of the country, AFP news agency reports, citing the USGS. Thailand is not an earthquake zone and nearly all earthquakes that are felt there, which are rare, are in neighbouring Myanmar.

        "title": "How will Australia choose its next prime minister? ",
        "short_description": "On 3 May Australians will head to the polls to vote in their first federal election since 2022.",
        "long_description": "On 3 May Australians will head to the polls to vote in their first federal election since 2022. The results will determine who the next prime minister will be, as well as the make-up of the nation's parliament. Australia famously has a unique electoral system - and some quirky polling day traditions. Voting is mandatory for all citizens over 18, the country uses preferential voting, and picking up a \"democracy sausage\" is a polling day custom. Almost 18 million people are registered to vote in this election - roughly 98% of those who are eligible. Unlike the First Past the Post system - used in the UK and most US states - which elects candidates based on who has received the greatest number of votes in a single count, regardless of whether they've secured an absolute majority - voters in Australia rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first tally, the votes from the least popular candidates are then redistributed, and that process repeated until someone secures a majority. In races for the House of Representatives, voters are required to mark a preference down for every single candidate listed on the ballot. However, in Senate races, voters only need to mark down a designated number of preferences. It is the leader of the party that receives the most seats in the House who then becomes prime minister. There is no separate leadership ballot. All of the seats in Australia's House of Representatives - that's 150 in this election -will be up for grabs, as will 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate. Australia has two major parties: the left-leaning Australian Labor Party and the conservative Liberal-National coalition. One party needs to win at least 76 seats in the House to form a majority government. If it cannot do that, it must try to win support from minor parties or independent MPs. In both state and federal elections, the vote share for minor parties and independents has been steadily increasing in Australia for decades. That reached record levels in the 2022 federal election, with one in three Australians casting votes for candidates outside the two major parties. Labor formed a majority government after winning the 2022 election, which delivered the biggest loss for the Liberal Party since its inception. As it stands, Labor has 78 seats in the House of Representatives, while the coalition has 57, with minor parties and independents splitting the remainder. But with one House seat abolished, if Labor loses just two seats at this election it will be stripped of its majority in parliament. In order to form a government in its own right, the coalition needs to win 19 seats, likely including many of those it lost to independent candidates during the 2022 vote. Anthony Albanese has been the prime minister since the last election, and a stalwart of parliament for almost 30 years. While he enjoyed a period of broad popularity after coming to power in 2022, he has in recent times come under pressure over his handling of divisive topics like housing, Indigenous affairs and both antisemitism and Islamophobia. Albanese is being challenged by Peter Dutton, who became head of the Liberal-National coalition after their 2022 defeat. He is contesting his first election as opposition leader. Known as a staunch conservative, Dutton has years of experience in important ministerial portfolios - like defence and home affairs - but has been a controversial figure at times, particularly on social issues. Both the polling and the political messaging around this year's election indicate that cost of living is the biggest concern for many voters. Since the 2022 election, inflation - which is now slowing - has pushed up the prices of everyday essentials such as food and utilities, leaving many households feeling stretched. The Albanese government has implemented a string of policies that it says are aimed at providing relief, such as keeping the cost of medications down, and offering tax cuts, energy rebates and rental assistance to those eligible. However, Australia has raised interest rates 12 times since Albanese was elected in May 2022 - something that is done independently of government but seen to reflect their economic management - and that has put additional pressure on borrowers and those with mortgages across the country. Housing affordability will also be a key issue this election cycle, with several Australian cities among the most expensive in the world for homebuyers. Historically, Australians are used to getting a result and knowing who will form government on election night. However, it is usually not the Australian Election Commission - the official body tasked with manually counting the votes - that declares this. Instead, the AEC provides what's known as an \"indicative count\" throughout the day, which media commentators, election experts and sometimes even the parties and candidates themselves then base their calls on. The AEC does not formally declare a seat until it is confident the result will not change based on the number of uncounted votes, which can sometimes take days. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "title": "King experiences temporary side effects of cancer treatment",
        "short_description": "King Charles III spent a short period of time in hospital on Thursday after experiencing temporary side effects during cancer treatment, Buckingham Palace said.",
        "long_description": "King Charles III spent a short period of time in hospital on Thursday after experiencing temporary side effects during cancer treatment, Buckingham Palace said. The King returned to Clarence House, where he was said to be continuing to work on state papers and make calls from his study. He has cancelled a tour of Birmingham on Friday, acting on medical advice. Charles, 76, had planned to travel to the city for a busy schedule of engagements, which included four events. The palace first announced the King's cancer diagnosis in February 2024. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said meetings with three ambassadors on Thursday were also affected. \"Tomorrow, he was due to undertake four public engagements in Birmingham and is greatly disappointed to be missing them on this occasion,\" the palace's statement added. \"He very much hopes that they can be rescheduled in due course and offers his deepest apologies to all those who had worked so hard to make the planned visit possible.\" A palace source described it as a \"most minor bump in a road that is very much heading in the right direction\". The palace did not provide further information over what his side effects were. Queen Camilla attended a reception in Wembley, north London on Thursday and did not join the King during his brief stay at hospital. After the palace released the news, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he \"wishes His Majesty the King all the very best\". The underlying message from the palace is one of reassurance \u2013 with the postponement of the visit to Birmingham presented as a brief setback against an otherwise optimistic picture on the King's health. There was no drama, they went to the London Clinic hospital in central London in a car and not an ambulance, and the late night announcement followed a decision that it was wiser to postpone Friday's visit. It might also have seemed wiser to get ahead of the news and remain transparent about a minor problem, rather than make it a major event with a last-minute cancellation. His cancer treatment is ongoing but the King has seemed keen not to be defined by his illness. He seems to thrive on meeting crowds and has shown no signs of slowing down, with a full set of engagements. This had made it possible to \"forget\" about the King's condition, said Robert Hardman, author of several books about the royal family. \"You think, here's the King doing what he likes doing, which is being out and about,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday. \"This is a sort of reminder that this is a head of state who is undergoing treatment for cancer.\" In recent weeks, the King has been on a trip to Northern Ireland, he launched a playlist of favourite music and attended the Commonwealth Day service, having missed it last year after his cancer diagnosis. The King has been centre-stage in recent weeks, unexpectedly involved in global diplomacy. After inviting President Donald Trump for a second state visit to the UK, the King then showed solidarity with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky after his disastrous meeting with Trump in the White House. He also gave a warm welcome to Mark Carney, Canada's new prime minister, whose country has been under pressure from Trump. None of that suggested that the monarch was running out of energy. And the postponement of the state visit to the Vatican, announced earlier this week, had been about the health of Pope Francis rather than the King - with the rest of the visit to Italy expected to go ahead. While recognising that it is impossible to rule out any further health problems, the message from Buckingham Palace is that the King is expected to be back to normal in terms of his diary next week. The King's wider state visit to Italy is also set to continue in April with some alterations to the planned programme, the palace said this week. The palace has never disclosed what type of cancer the King has. He returned to public duties last April after a period of treatment and recuperation. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

        "title": "Albanese faces headwinds ahead of Australian election",
        "short_description": "When Cyclone Alfred barrelled over Australia's east coast earlier this month, it also blew the government's election plans off course.",
        "long_description": "When Cyclone Alfred barrelled over Australia's east coast earlier this month, it also blew the government's election plans off course. Hoping to capitalise on some rare good news on interest rates, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was on the cusp of announcing an April polling date. Instead he had to pivot and focus on responding to the natural disaster. It was, one Labor Minister told me, a decision taken from him by \"an act of God\". You might say that's been a theme of his government: big plans often derailed by unpleasant surprises \u2013 trying global economic conditions and a cost-of-living crisis which is battering many countries, foreign wars and tricky geopolitics, post-pandemic fallout and rising national divisions, and now giant storms. \"Global conditions are real,\" Albanese, who leads the Labor Party, said as he officially announced a 3 May election. Though, despite those challenges, he says his party has delivered. \"Landing where we have is like landing a 747 [jet] on a helicopter pad,\" he said, pointing to a recent increase in wage growth and falling inflation. But he wants a second term to reset. Standing in his way is Peter Dutton - a conservative who leads the Liberal Party, the dominant member of the so-called Coalition with the National Party of Australia \u2013 who just two years ago polling indicated was deeply unpopular. But the race between them is now so tight and the rise of independents or minor parties such that many are expecting a hung parliament. So how has it unravelled for Prime Minister Albanese? His victory in May 2022 was seen as a fresh start after nine years of conservative rule. Climate action was big on the agenda, as was addressing the cost-of-living and restoring stability to the country's leadership. But the legacy he eyed for his government was on Indigenous affairs. He opened his victory speech reiterating a pledge to hold a historic referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, an advisory body that would inform the government on issues that affect First Nations people. Albanese spent most of 2023 campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote. This was the moment, he hoped, that First Nations people would get constitutional recognition - finally catching up with other former British colonies - and that Australia would begin mending what many see as a very broken relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But the proposal was decisively rejected, leaving many Indigenous people feeling disappointed and betrayed. Albanese was also left licking his wounds after a damaging campaign. Some critics blamed confusion and misinformation for why about 60% of Australians voted \"No\". But while Albanese was campaigning for the \"Yes\" vote, opposition leader Peter Dutton campaigned for \"No\", attacking Albanese for spending money on the referendum while a cost-of-living crisis intensified. \"[Dutton] not only won on the referendum, but also he won on positioning Labor as the government that's not completely focused on the issues that matter to Australia,\" says Kos Samaras, political consultant and a former Labor strategist. During Albanese's tenure, interest rates have been put up 12 times (and cut once, in February), inflation soared post-pandemic, the country's housing crisis deepened, and Australians increasingly felt stretched. Though the prime minister would lay the blame for many of those issues at the previous coalition government's feet, voters want to know who is best placed to deal with all of them now. In Anthony Albanese's victory speech in 2022, he said Australia was \"the greatest country on earth\". Australian voters though are increasingly questioning whether that's still true \u2013 and perhaps more importantly, whether politicians from traditional parties are the ones able to fix it. So though many are disillusioned with Labor, this won't necessarily translate as a vote for Dutton's Coalition at the ballot box. Support for minor parties and independents reached record levels at the previous election, and similar is expected this time around. If neither party reaches the magic number of 76 seats in the House of Representatives, which poll after poll paints as unlikely, independent candidates could be the kingmakers of any future government. If that happens, Australia would be another page in a story unfolding all over the world - disenfranchised voters seeking more radical solutions and voting for change. In many places this is a real threat to democracy as people stop trusting the system. But while Australia faces the same challenges as other parts of the world, a few quirks in its electoral system have thus far guarded against more radical swings that we've seen in other countries, like the US, France and Germany. Experts all agree that mandatory voting is a key factor in Australia's political stability. In the 2022 elections, just under 90% of the population voted \u2013 much, much higher than the average OECD turnout of 69%. The fine for not voting in a federal election is a mere A$20 but there's a sense of duty here to go out and vote. What that means is politicians don't have to mobilise their bases \u2013 turnout is a given, it's just about pushing your narrative. Where voting is optional, there's a tendency for special interest groups to become overly influential as those who are less engaged decide not to cast a ballot. Plus, if everyone, no matter their politics, education or their wealth, goes to vote, it tends to pull the result towards a more representative centre. \"[Australia's] elections are decided in the middle,\" says the country's chief election analyst Antony Green. \"That means getting your message through those people who aren't paying much attention.\" The other big stabiliser for Australia, say experts, is preferential voting \u2013 where voters effectively number their candidates in order of who they want to win. It's why in recent years the Greens have emerged on the left and One Nation on the right but still, Labor and the Coalition dominate. Experts say preferential voting tempers the effects of polarisation and forces the two major parties to appeal to people who aren't necessarily voting for them first in order to receive their next preferences, which also helps moderate policy. While the campaign will focus on problems close to home, the candidates would be foolish to ignore the global political headwinds. During last year's presidential election, few analysts I spoke to seemed to think a Trump White House would massively impact Australia, this comparatively small and distant democracy. But five months feels like a lifetime in today's politics. Not a day goes by without Donald Trump making the headlines and Australians are tuning in to watch. With Trump's obvious disregard for longstanding alliances as well as constant talk of tariffs and trade wars, all this plays a part in Australians' fears about their place in the world \u2013 and importantly, the future of what is arguably its most important diplomatic and military relationship. Peter Dutton argues he'd be much better than Albanese at dealing with Trump. But there are doubts that anyone really knows how to handle this new administration \u2013 politicians of all stripes around the globe are feeling their way with how best to manage their relationship with the US. With Albanese firing the starting gun today, Australians have just over a month of intense campaigning to help them determine who they want to lead them through the next three years. While Labor's handling of the ex-cyclone Alfred has improved its chances \u2013 the Prime Minister's approval ratings have risen to their highest level in 18 months \u2013 polling in recent months has pointed towards a Dutton administration. It's still incredibly close, and the Albanese government faces the unenviable prospect of being the first which fails to win a second term since 1931. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

        "title": "How will car firms be affected by Trump's tariffs?",
        "short_description": "A day after US President Donald Trump said he would hit foreign cars and car parts with a new import tax of 25%, many of the world's biggest automakers appeared stunned into silence, as they took in a move expected to wreak havoc across the industry.",
        "long_description": "A day after US President Donald Trump said he would hit foreign cars and car parts with a new import tax of 25%, many of the world's biggest automakers appeared stunned into silence, as they took in a move expected to wreak havoc across the industry. Investors sold off shares of carmakers in Japan, Germany and the UK on Thursday, wiping billions of value off names such as Toyota, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover. Firms in America were some of the hardest hit, with General Motors down more than 7%. Shares in Tesla, which is known for its US factories and whose boss Elon Musk is one of Trump's biggest donors and closest advisers, were notably spared from the hit, ending the day flat. But Musk warned that even his company would not be immune from the tariff disruption. \"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here,\" Musk wrote on social media. \"The cost impact is not trivial.\" Tesla's Model Y, which topped Cars.com's 2024 index of American-made cars for the third year running, only sources 70% of its parts from the US, according to Patrick Masterson, lead researcher for the list. \"The major takeaway I think people should know about this is no vehicle is 100% US-made,\" he said. \"The consumer is going to feel it across the board and I really don't think that any automaker is going to be spared from this, Tesla included.\" The latest tariffs could affect roughly $300bn-$400bn in imports, depending on what parts are affected by the order, according to Macquarie. That amounts to almost 10% of everything the US brings into the country each year. It is expected to push up prices by roughly $4,000 to $12,000, depending on the vehicle. Many major car companies have operations in the US, while also bringing in models, or parts from outside of the US. Japan's Toyota, for example, has 10 manufacturing plants in the US and its Highlander SUV ranks highly on the American-made list. But its Prius ships in from Japan. General Motors also brings in significant parts and cars from Korea and Mexico, which Volkswagen also relies on heavily, despite assembling the Atlas SUV in the US. Some firms may be able to redirect work to factories in the US, Oxford Economics has suggested, but it warned that such a move was likely to lead to higher prices and \"significantly lower production in the US's main trading partners\". The action is likely to have a more significant impact on carmakers exporting from Germany and the UK, which are known for selling fewer, more premium and luxury brands at higher prices, such as Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz and Audi. Ferrari, which ships its cars from Italy, immediately announced a 10% price hike, to help cover the new cost of the duty. As companies are forced to respond to the 25% tariffs, by raising prices or accepting lower profits, some may decide to pull some models out of the US entirely, leading to fewer choices for American consumers, warned Patrick Anderson, chief executive of the Anderson Economic Group. This could also lead to carmakers without a current large manufacturing presence in the US, such as Jaguar Land Rover or Porsche, reducing production in their home countries, potentially affecting jobs. All Mitsubishi cars sold in the US are imported, while Hyundai, which announced plans for a plant in the US earlier this week, ships most of its cars from South Korea. Trump, who started discussing tariffs on cars in his first term, said his latest tariff enforcement would be permanent, claiming it will boost America's manufacturing base. It follows previous moves to impose tariffs of at least 20% on goods being imported into the US from China along with 25% levies on some goods from Canada and Mexico. A 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering America is also already in force. He is also set to introduce so-called reciprocal tariffs against individual countries based on their trade balance with the US. The White House said the car duties would start on April 3, while tariffs on certain car parts are set to come into effect a month later. For now, parts made in Mexico and Canada - which have traditionally entered the US under a free trade agreement - will be spared, while officials get custom systems prepared. The carve-out for parts from Mexico and Canada, which the White House said would be temporary, was a relief to some in the industry. But General Motors is still facing potential increased costs starting at about $10.5bn, according to JP Morgan. Ford's bill would start at roughly $2bn, more than doubling over time as tariffs on parts come into effect, according to estimates from the banking giant. It said the added cost across the industry would amount to more than $80bn. Jennifer Safavian, president of Autos Drive America, which represents international carmakers, said her members were still working out the repercussions of the move and other tariffs that have been recently announced or are looming. But she warned that the measure would lead to higher prices, fewer sales, and less production across the industry. \"They're trying to digest this,\" she said. \"But again there's no question that these tariffs are going to have an impact on the US auto industry.\" Paul and Cass Geary are part of four generations of their family to have worked at the plant. Nissan's skills foundation celebrates its 10th anniversary of delivering programmes to young people. The BBC went to car dealerships outside of Washington DC to ask drivers how a 25% auto tariff will affect them. Morgan Motor Company exports 200 sports cars to the US a year, which is a third of overall revenue, says managing director Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists fear they could spark a trade war.

        "title": "Starmer accuses Putin of 'playing games' over Ukraine peace deal",
        "short_description": "Western sanctions on Russia need to be increased, not weakened, in order to bring it to the negotiating table, Sir Keir Starmer has said.",
        "long_description": "Western sanctions on Russia need to be increased, not weakened, in order to bring it to the negotiating table, Sir Keir Starmer has said. The prime minister accused Vladimir Putin of \"playing games and playing for time\" after the Russian president demanded sanctions were lifted before a US-brokered maritime ceasefire is enacted. \"Now is not the time for pulling back or weakening sanctions - now is the time to increase sanctions to get them to the table,\" Starmer said in Paris, where he is meeting European leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron, co-hosting Thursday's so-called \"coalition of the willing\" summit, has suggested a European reassurance force could \"respond\" if attacked by Moscow. Starmer said on Thursday a \"framework and a deadline\" was needed for Ukraine peace talks. He said he had agreed with partners at the summit, which hosted representatives from 30 nations as well as the European Union and Nato, that \"we must go further now to support the peace process, support Ukraine and increase the pressure on Russia to get serious\". \"It means increasing the economic pressure on Russia, accelerating new tougher sanctions, bearing down on Russia's energy revenues, and working together to make this pressure count,\" he said. Starmer said that the political mood to find a just and lasting peace in Ukraine was \"stronger and broader\" than it had ever been, adding that \"Europe as a whole has not been this strong and united in a long time\". The UK will chair the next meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact group, comprised of dozens of countries, to deliver further military aid and \"keep Ukraine in the fight\", Starmer said. The prime minister said defence chiefs from the UK, France and Germany would also be meeting in Ukraine, but did not specify a date. Speaking with Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier, Starmer accused Russia of \"continuing to inflict devastating attacks on the Ukrainian people\" and said Putin's promises were \"hollow\". Zelensky said that everybody at the meeting understood \"that Russia doesn't want any kind of peace\" and was \"dragging out the war, adding that they would discuss security guarantees in the coming weeks and days. In a post on X, the Ukrainian leader thanked the UK and France for their support and shared a picture of himself and Starmer holding talks, describing the plans as a \"coalition of strength for the sake of peace\". \"Our unity and joint work in Europe, with the United States, and other partners, can force Russia into peace,\" Zelensky added. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaking the terms of a separate, tentative deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure. Washington announced the Black Sea deal had been agreed on Tuesday, after holding separate talks with delegations from Ukraine and Russia in Saudi Arabia. But just hours later, the Kremlin said it would not take effect until sanctions were lifted on Russian banks, producers and exporters involved in the international food and fertiliser trades. Moscow's demands include reconnecting Russian banks involved in the agrifood trade to the Swift payment system, lifting restrictions on servicing ships under the Russian flag involved in the food trade, and revoking sanctions on the supply of agricultural machinery and other goods involved in food production. US President Donald Trump said the US government was \"looking at\" Moscow's request - but the EU said it would not consider removing sanctions before the \"unconditional\" withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's internationally-recognised territory. Zelensky said on Wednesday he hoped the US - which is not a part of the coalition of the willing - would \"stand strong\" in the face of Russian demands. Macron confirmed that European countries had \"unanimously agreed\" that sanctions against Moscow should not be lifted. \"The time is not ripe to lift sanctions... We need to keep economic pressure up,\" he said. The French president said that if a European force protecting a ceasefire in Ukraine came under attack, it would \"respond to it\". \"If there was again a generalised aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would be under attack, and then it's our usual framework of engagement,\" he said. \"Our soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.\" The UK and France are leading efforts to send a force to Ukraine to deter any future Russian aggression in the event of a ceasefire. Starmer reiterated on Thursday that Parliament should have a say on deploying troops. European leaders put on a show of unity in Paris. In reality many have already ruled out sending troops to Ukraine. Countries including Finland and Poland feel under direct threat from Russia and feel their troops need to protect their own borders. Others fear deploying soldiers would be a deeply unpopular decision at home. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni \u2013 who has repeatedly expressed her scepticism at the Franco-British plan \u2013 has been working to put forward an \"alternative\" option which would see soldiers serve in Ukraine exclusively as part of a United Nations military contingent. European officials say that under any peace settlement, Ukraine's first line of defence against any future Russian attack would be its own army. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said a European force in Ukraine would risk a \"direct clash between Russia and Nato\", state-owned news agency Tass reports. \"London and Paris continue to nurture the idea of a military intervention into Ukraine. All of that is being cloaked under [the guise of] a certain peacekeeping mission,\" Zakharova said. She added Russia was \"categorically against such a scenario\". A Hereford cafe owner is back from Ukraine after a dangerous aid mission. Speaking in the Arctic, Russia's president said Trump's plans were \"serious\" but nothing to do with Moscow.

        "long_description": "Five people have been injured following a stabbing near the central Dam Square in Amsterdam, police say. The injured include two Americans, a Polish man, a Belgian woman and a Dutch woman. The youngest is 19 and the oldest 73, police add. The male suspect, who has been arrested, was overpowered with the help of bystanders and taken to hospital with a leg injury. Police say the motive behind the attack is \"under investigation\" but they are considering the possibility that the suspect may have chosen people at random. The Amsterdam mayor Femke Halsema said a police investigation was \"in full swing\" and authorities hoped to uncover more details of what happened soon. \"Our hearts go out to the victims, their families, and loved ones,\" she said. The wounded people are a 67-year-old woman and a 69-year-old man, both from the US; a 26-year-old man from Poland; a 73-year-old woman from Belgium; and a 19-year-old woman from Amsterdam. Police said just before 15:30 local time (14:30 GMT) emergency services received several reports of a stabbing incident. Officers then quickly arrived at the scene and found five injured people at various locations in and around Sint Nicolaasstraat in the centre of the city, police said. With the help of bystanders, officers apprehended a suspect shortly after the incident, police said. Authorities cordoned-off a large area around the Royal Palace in the central Dam Square, where an emergency helicopter landed. The square is popular with tourists lying at the heart of the historic district of the city. One witness told the Dutch paper De Telegraaf that they suddenly heard an \"icy scream\" and after that panic broke out in the area. A shop assistant also said that she heard a lot of shouting and screaming and that people started running, the paper reported. Amsterdam outlet Het Parool quoted a witness saying he approached a girl after hearing a noise. As someone else shouted to call an ambulance, he saw a knife \"sticking out from the girl's back, between her shoulders\". The police are urging anyone with images of the incident to upload them as evidence. The number of injured people was for a time said to be four, but in a later update the police said five people were wounded as well as the suspect. Four rioters are jailed after a Europa League match between Ajax and Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv. Some fans attending the game in Paris jeer the Israeli anthem played at the start of the game.

        "long_description": "Chinese technology giant Tencent has made a \u20ac1.2bn ($1.25bn; \u00a31bn) investment in a spin-off from Ubisoft, the maker of the Assassin's Creed video games. Shenzhen-based Tencent will own about a quarter of the new business, with Ubisoft holding the rest of the new subsidiary, which is valued at around \u20ac4bn. The unit will run some of the French firm's biggest franchises, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. Tencent, which is one of the world's biggest video games developers, is also known for its internet-based services, including the hugely popular messaging app WeChat. \"Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history,\" Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft's co-founder and chief executive said in a statement. Tencent, which is China's most valuable company, is now Ubisoft's second biggest shareholder with a stake of just under 10%. \"We are excited to extend our longstanding partnership with Ubisoft through this investment,\" Martin Lau, President of Tencent, said. Ubisoft said it will now focus on its other marquee titles, including Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon and The Division. Ubisoft's stock market value has fallen sharply in recent years after delays to the launches of new games and falling sales. That's despite its shares getting a boost earlier this month as investors welcomed the launch of the latest instalment of the Assassin's Creed franchise. The much-anticipated Assassin's Creed Shadows had been delayed several times. It followed the disappointing performance of another of the firm's major titles, Star Wars Outlaws, and concerns from some onlookers about how Ubisoft is being run. \"Ubisoft has all these great games, like Assassin's Creed, that it's known for that recently haven't delivered so much for fans,\" video games journalist Shannon Liao told the BBC. \"There are reasons for why that business is now up for grabs and for Tencent it's an opportunity for them to cash in on these franchises that are so beloved, that have so much street cred for gamers out there.\" The Assassin's Creed series has sold more than 200 million copies worldwide and, according to a Ubisoft earnings report published last year, generated about \u20ac4bn revenue in the decade up to 2024. Start-up social media firms are looking to capitalise on dissatisfaction with the social media giants. Vietnam's Prime Minister has said he would \"golf all day long\" with the US president if it benefits his country. Trump also said he is willing to extend a 5 April deadline for a non-Chinese buyer of the platform to be found. Shares in technology firms have both fallen and risen sharply over the past year.

        "title": "Trump targets 'anti-American ideology' at Smithsonian museums",
        "short_description": "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order targeting the Smithsonian Institution, which operates more than 20 museums and research centres visited by millions yearly in Washington DC and New York City.",
        "long_description": "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order targeting the Smithsonian Institution, which operates more than 20 museums and research centres visited by millions yearly in Washington DC and New York City. The order directs the vice-president to \"eliminate improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology\" from the institute's museums, centres and the National Zoo in Washington. It also directs the interior secretary to restore federal properties, including parks, memorials and statues, which \"have been improperly removed or changed in the last five years to perpetuate a false revision of history\". The move is part of Trump's effort to shape American culture, in addition to politics. The order is titled \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\". It says that Vice-President JD Vance, who became a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents due to his position in government, will lead the purge. Trump's order says that Congress should not fund Smithsonian exhibits and programmes that \"divide Americans by race\". It alleges that the American Women's History Museum, which is in development, plans to \"recognize men as women\". It also singles out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, saying that the museum \"has proclaimed that 'hard work,' 'individualism,' and 'the nuclear family' are aspects of 'White culture'.\" The museum opened in 2016 in Washington as former President Barack Obama, America's first black president, was leaving office. The Smithsonian museums offer free entry to some 15 to 30 million visitors each year. It operates 21 museums in Washington, Virgina and New York. They include the National Museum of American History, the National Portrait Gallery, the American Art Museum, the National Zoo and more than a dozen others. The order also instructs Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to complete \"restorations and improvements\" to Independence Hall in Philadelphia. It comes ahead of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which took place within the building. Trump has set out to radically reshape American culture, which he says has been contaminated by \"woke\" left-wing ideology. He has signed several orders that are intended to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programmes from the federal government - some of which led to legal challenges. Shortly after taking office, Trump fired the board of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC, and installed himself as chairman. The move led to widespread criticism from actors and directors, causing several to cancel upcoming performances. The music icon was shot and killed by the founder of her fan club, who has been denied her first attempt at parole in Texas. The BBC asked Canadian voters in Toronto how they would approach Donald Trump if they were prime minister. How much attention did you pay to what has been going on in the world over the past seven days?

        "long_description": "Firefighters are racing to battle the largest wildfires in South Korea's history, which have so far killed 27 people. Dry weather and strong winds have proved to be a deadly combination in exacerbating the fire. The BBC's Rachel Lee explores how the fire is spreading and the damage it has caused to the country.

        "long_description": "President Volodymyr Zelensky was in a buoyant mood when I met him in Paris with a panel of three other European journalists. He had interrupted a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace and went back there for what he called a \"t\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate dinner\" after the interview. Macron had not just rolled out the red carpet for him. The Eiffel Tower, behind Zelensky in a picture window as we talked in one of Paris's great museums, was lit up in yellow and blue, the colours of the Ukrainian national flag. The French wanted him to feel as if he was among friends. Zelensky had come to Paris to meet leaders and diplomats from 30 other countries who are working out what they can contribute to the \"coalition of the willing\", the group that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to organise to offer Ukraine security guarantees if there is a long-term ceasefire. Zelensky's welcome in Paris was a clear contrast to the dressing down he was given by US President Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance when he visited the White House last month. After their verbal attack, Zelensky was unceremoniously turfed out of the White House and not long afterwards Trump ordered the suspension of American military aid and intelligence to Ukraine. It was restored after Zelensky, advised by the British, the French and other European allies, went out of his way to mend his fences with Trump and his administration. He switched to the kind of flattering language Trump demands and agreed to an American plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. He dropped his insistence on US security guarantees first, to underpin any ceasefire. But even though US military and intelligence assistance is flowing, Trump's ruthless suspension of it, which cost Ukrainian lives, has left a deep sense of unease in Ukraine and among its European allies. The evidence is piling up that Trump's United States is not a reliable ally. It is getting easier to sketch out scenarios in which it might not be an ally at all. Most European leaders still try to act publicly as if the 80-year-old alliance with the US is healthy. But the gathering of 30 countries in Paris shows they realise they can no longer rely on the benevolence of the United States. American presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 1950s have complained, with good reason, about Europeans getting a free ride from the US security blanket over Europe. Trump has finally pulled it away. During the interview, Zelensky praised the array of plans that are being formulated in western Europe \u2013 led by the UK, France and Germany \u2013 to spend more on defence. He suggested that in three to five years, \"if everything goes as it is now\", Europe might even catch up with the United States. At best, that is a highly optimistic estimate, less an accurate forecast and more a gesture of appreciation for European allies who unlike the Americans attach very few conditions and strings to support for Ukraine. Europe, Zelensky said, \"has discipline and no chaos\". That might be seen as an oblique and unflattering comparison with the twists and turns coming out of the Trump White House. I asked him about the conditions Russia's President Vladimir Putin has attached to the latest small step in the Trump peace initiative, which is a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea. After Ukraine and Russia held separate meetings with the Americans in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin issued a statement that required concessions as Russia's price for a ceasefire. The most significant demand was for a state-owned Russian bank to be readmitted to the Swift system for international payments. That would open a door back into mainstream global commerce for Russia. That decision does not depend on Trump, as Swift is based in Belgium. The European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman responded with a statement saying one of the \"main preconditions\" for lifting or amending sanctions on Russia was \"the end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine\". Even Trump, reluctant to criticise Putin, suggested that Russia might be \"dragging its feet\" in the negotiations with the US. It reminded him of his own business career. He told the US cable channel Newsmax that \"I've done it over the years\u2026 I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game.\" I asked Zelensky where the push for a ceasefire stood, given Russia's demands. He called for a resolute response from the Americans. \"If America is going to stand strong and not bend to the conditions of the Russians - we stand on our land. \"We are defending it; we have shown our resilience to everyone\u2026 And now it's very important that our partners would be resilient and strong, at least at the minimum, as we are.\" I asked whether he believed the Americans would, as he put it, stay strong. \"I hope so. I hope so. God bless they will. But we'll see.\" Zelensky has no choice about stating his faith in Trump's America, even though he must have grave doubts. Trump's decision to punish Ukraine by cutting off military intelligence about Russia missile launches had an immediate and deadly impact, and Zelensky had to work hard to get Trump to relent. He does not want it to happen again. He was open about why he had to try to stay close to Trump, even as the US president seemed to be prioritising the restoration of relations with Moscow as he repeated Russian propaganda points, not least the lie that Ukraine started the war. \"We needed to unblock the aid from the US. For us, the exchange of intelligence is very important.\" That did not stop Zelensky rebuking comments made by Steve Witkoff, Trump's super envoy, a real estate billionaire turned diplomat who deals with the Middle East as well as the Russian-Ukraine war. In an interview last week with Tucker Carlson, a right-wing podcaster in the United States, Witkoff disparaged the drive by the UK's Starmer and France's Macron to create the \"coalition of the willing\" to support Ukraine. The American said it was a posture and pose, \"a simplistic desire\" to sound like Winston Churchill. His words fit squarely into what seems now to be a settled view in the Trump Administration that their erstwhile allies in Europe are a parasitical burden on the United States. What if Witkoff was right? Strip away the insults and recognise that Europe's richest nations have chosen, for decades, to spend most of their considerable wealth on matters they consider more pressing than their militaries. Zelensky said Witkoff and others in the Trump administration, had fallen for Russian propaganda. \"I think that Witkoff often quotes the Kremlin narratives\u2026 I can't be ungrateful to the Americans for everything they did, but they are often, unfortunately, under the influence of Russian narratives. And we cannot agree with these narratives.\" Zelensky suggested that Witkoff was better at his old job, developing real estate in Manhattan. \"He doesn't look like a military man. He doesn't look like a general, and he doesn't have such experience. As far as I know, he is very good at selling and buying real estate. And this is a little different.\" President Zelensky, for a man who has lived with immense pressure since Russia's full scale invasion more than three years ago, was remarkably buoyant, clearly pleased by the reception he had in Paris and the efforts that President Macron and Prime Minister Starmer are making to rally European support and to persuade, even cajole, Trump not to cut intelligence and military support to Ukraine. Zelensky seemed happy with his new strategy of agreeing to temporary ceasefires to force Putin to show his reluctance to pause the war. I asked Zelensky how he was dealing with the pressure. His goal, he said, was for his children to be able \"to walk down the street and not have to hide.\" And how did he think he'd be remembered; as the man who saved Ukraine, or tried to and failed? Zelensky grimaced slightly. Better, he said, than Putin, who was getting old and feared his own people. \"He will die soon. It is a fact. His reign could end before he finishes his historically insignificant and unsuccessful life. This is what he fears.\" Zelensky laughed. \"And I will do everything I can to defend Ukraine as much as I can. And I am definitely younger than Putin.\" Trump might be hoping for a deal by Easter. Zelensky is still looking to the long haul. A Hereford cafe owner is back from Ukraine after a dangerous aid mission. Speaking in the Arctic, Russia's president said Trump's plans were \"serious\" but nothing to do with Moscow. Another 39 people were rescued after the vessel sank in the Red Sea on Thursday morning. The law will allow Polish authorities to temporarily spend asylum rights at the border with Belarus. Four friends who work for the ambulance service in Bristol are making the journey to Lviv.
