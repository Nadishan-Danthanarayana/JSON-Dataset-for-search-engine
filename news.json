        "short_description": "Nigel Farage has defended Elon Musk after the billionaire attacked the UK government's response to grooming gangs on X, the social media platform he owns.",
        "long_description": "Nigel Farage has defended Elon Musk after the billionaire attacked the UK government's response to grooming gangs on X, the social media platform he owns. In a series of posts over several days, Musk suggested Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute gangs and said Home Office minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\". It came as the Home Office defended its decision to reject a request for it to lead a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. The Conservatives and Reform UK have called for a wider national inquiry. Asked about Musk's comments on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Farage said he had used \"very tough terms\" but that \"free speech was back\" on X under his ownership. Farage was also pressed on his wider relationship with Musk, who is said to be considering donating money to his Reform party. Musk's latest intervention on UK politics came after Phillips, a safeguarding minister within the Home Office, instructed Oldham Council to launch its own local inquiry into historic child sexual abuse in the town, similar to inquiries set up in Rochdale and Telford. The local authority had called for a government-led inquiry. The tech tycoon seized on the decision, which was taken in October, and began heavily criticising the British government online. He suggested Sir Keir had failed to properly prosecute rape gangs while director of public prosecutions (DPP), and has repeatedly shared posts from Reform and Conservative MPs calling for a national inquiry. Musk, who is a key advisor to incoming US President Donald Trump, called the prime minister \"two-tier Keir\" and accused Phillips of being a \"rape genocide apologist\". Asked about the comments, Farage said \"tough things get said... by both sides of the debate\". He continued: \"This man happens to be the richest man in the world, but equally, the fact that he's bought Twitter now actually gives us a place where we can have a proper open debate about many things... We may find it offensive, but it's a good thing, not a bad thing.\" Earlier this week, Farage distanced himself from Musk's support for Tommy Robinson - a far-right activist who is serving a jail term for committing contempt of court. In an interview to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday morning, Farage said the public is \"absolutely right to be\" angry about grooming gangs. He went on: \"I just think people ask themselves, what has happened to our country? How could this possibly have happened? Why did everybody want to cover it up? Why has there been no full public inquiry?\" On Saturday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended Phillips as \"fearless and formidable\" and someone who has campaigned \"tirelessly for justice for those badly let down by endemic institutional failure\" for many years. In a separate letter seen by the BBC, Phillips and Cooper wrote to the Conservatives setting out why they had asked Oldham Council to set up its own inquiry, rather than grant its request for a government-led one. The previous Conservative government turned down a similar request in 2022. The letter pointed out the local authority had already started setting up its own inquiry, and added that victims have said \"loud and clear\" they want action. \"In Oldham the crimes committed by grooming gangs were horrific,\" they wrote. \"Young girls were abused in the most cruel and sadistic way. Victims and the community need to know that all steps are taken to deliver justice and protect children properly in the future.\" They said they supported an independent review commissioned by Mayor Andy Burnham, which covered historic abuse in Oldham and led to a new police investigation, as well as other child protection work across Greater Manchester. The letter highlighted the work of the Child Sexual Abuse Inquiry, which published its final findings in 2022. It made clear that \"abuse must be pursued and challenged everywhere with no fear or favour\" - whether in care homes, churches, homes or by grooming gangs. Professor Alexis Jay, who led that inquiry, said in November she felt \"frustrated\" that none of its 20 recommendations to tackle abuse had been implemented more than two years later. On Friday, Health Secretary West Streeting said the government was getting \"on with the job\" of implementing the recommendations \"in full\" since taking office in July. There have been several investigations into grooming gangs in various parts of England, including Rotherham, Bristol, Cornwall and Derbyshire. An inquiry into abuse in Rotherham found 1,400 children had been sexually abused over a 16-year period, predominantly by British Pakistani men. An investigation in Telford found that up to 1,000 girls had been abused over 40 years - and that some cases had not been investigated because of \"nervousness about race\". Police figures from 2023 reveal that group-based child sexual abuse accounted for 3.7% of all sexual offences against children reported to police. According to the data, 26% of group-based child sexual abuse happened within families, compared with 17% involving groups including grooming gangs. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

        "short_description": "Americans have been gathering to remember Jimmy Carter as a nearly week-long state funeral gets under way for the 39th US president.",
        "long_description": "Americans have been gathering to remember Jimmy Carter as a nearly week-long state funeral gets under way for the 39th US president. Saturday's procession from Carter's home in Plains, Georgia, to Atlanta marked the beginning of the six-day public goodbye for the statesman, who passed away last month aged 100. Carter will be flown to Washington DC on Tuesday where he will lie in state at the US Capitol before a service on Thursday that will feature remarks from former American presidents. Mourners from the state of Georgia and around the world have gathered in Atlanta to pay their respects. Among those who came on Saturday was Heather Brooks, an Atlanta resident and \"great admirer\" of the Democrat. \"[I] found him to be always kind, relatable, just an awesome individual who has done so much for the world, not just America,\" Ms Brooks told the BBC. She said she had met Carter a handful of times and described him as \"powerful yet so humble\". Paige Alexander, the head of the Carter Center, told the BBC that the ex-president should be remembered for his \"sincerity and integrity\". \"I mean, at the end of the day, you have a politician who would say during a debate, you know, 'the Honourable President [Gerald] Ford and I disagree on these issues',\" Ms Alexander said. \"You don't hear that now.\" The grassy area outside the Carter Center has been overflowing with flowers, handwritten tributes and bags of peanuts, a reference to Carter's early years as a peanut farmer in Plains. Those who knew the former president well, like Jill Stuckey, a long-time friend of the Carter family, said she will miss his - and his wife Rosalynn's - commitment to helping others. That's something Ms Stuckey said the couple was committed to \"until the day they passed\". \"I don't know how we're going to get used to a world without President Carter,\" she told the BBC. On Saturday the motorcade passed the Methodist church where the Carters married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn, who died in late 2023 aged 96. The procession also stopped in front of Carter's boyhood home and family farm just outside Plains. The site is now part of Jimmy Carter National Historical Park, which rang the old farm bell on Saturday 39 times to honour the 39th president. The motorcade then stopped at the Georgia state capitol building for a moment of silence led by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp. Mourners will be able to visit Carter at the presidential library on 5 January and 6 January before he is flown to Washington DC on 7 January. For two days he will lie in state at the US Capitol Rotunda, where the public will be able to pay their respects. His life will be commemorated at Washington National Cathedral on 9 January in a service attended by several former presidents. On top of the political praise Carter is expected to receive in the coming days will be the personal tributes from his extended family. For Jason Carter, the former president's grandson, it is the personal connection he had with people that he will especially miss. \"I think for many people in the country he was a beacon of love and respect and I think that's worth celebrating,\" the former Georgia state senator told the BBC.

        "short_description": "Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer says he will resign in the coming days, both as chancellor and party leader, after talks about forming a coalition government collapsed.",
        "long_description": "Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer says he will resign in the coming days, both as chancellor and party leader, after talks about forming a coalition government collapsed. The chancellor said his party - the conservative People's Party (\u00d6VP) - and the Social Democrats had failed to agree on key issues. The liberal Neos, another party involved in the talks, also pulled out on Friday. In September the far-right Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) won an unprecedented victory in Austria's general election, but the other parties ruled out forming a coalition with the FP\u00d6's leader Herbert Kickl. The collapse of the talks could lead to the conservatives negotiating with the far-right, or to a new election taking place, analysts have said. The Russia-friendly FP\u00d6 has been in a ruling coalition before. It would likely welcome a new election as opinion polls suggest its popularity has grown further since September. The FP\u00d6 has said in a statement on X that three months have been lost by the coalition talks and adds that \"instead of stability, we have chaos\". The party has called for Social Democrat leader Andreas Babler to also resign and said President Alexander Van der Bellen bears \"a significant share of responsibility for the chaos that has arisen and the lost time\". The FP\u00d6 won almost 29% of the vote in September's election, the People's Party came second with 26.3% and the Social Democrats third, with 21%. There was a high turnout of 77.3% as Austrian voters took part in an election dominated by the twin issues of migration and asylum, as well as a flagging economy and the war in Ukraine. The FP\u00d6's Kickl promised to build \"Fortress Austria\", to restore Austrians' security and prosperity. The party wants firm rules on legal immigration and it has promoted the idea of remigration, which involves sending asylum seekers to their original countries. The FP\u00d6 was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s. Two days before last year's general election vote some of its candidates were caught on video at a funeral where an SS song was sung. The party later denied the song, dating back to 1814, had any link to \"National Socialist sentiments\". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

        "long_description": "A contingent of 150 Guatemalan soldiers has arrived in Haiti, tasked with helping to restore order amid the chaos wrought by armed gangs. A first group of 75 soldiers arrived on Friday and another 75 on Saturday, all drafted from the military police, according to Guatemala's government. A state of emergency has been in place across the Caribbean nation for months as the government battles violent gangs that have taken control of much of the capital Port-au-Prince. The forces are in Haiti to boost a United Nations-backed security mission led by Kenya that has so far failed to prevent violence from escalating. Kenya sent nearly 400 police officers in June and July last year to help combat the gangs. This was the first tranche of a UN-approved international force that will be made up of 2,500 officers from various countries. A small number of forces from Jamaica, Belize and El Salvador are also in Haiti as part of the mission and the US is the operation's largest funder. In March 2024, armed gangs stormed Haiti's two biggest prisons, freeing around 3,700 inmates. The Ouest Department - a region including Port-au-Prince - was originally put under a state of emergency on 3 March, after escalating violence gripped the capital. Chronic instability, dictatorships and natural disasters in recent decades have left Haiti the poorest nation in the Americas. In 2021, President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in Port-au-Prince. Since then the country has been wracked by economic chaos, little functioning political control and increasingly violent gang warfare. Authorities in Guatemala resist efforts by a Jewish sect to recapture 160 children rescued from its premises. A firefighter dressed as Santa abseils down a bridge in Guatemala City to give gifts to children. The charity acts after an attack on its staff in the capital and the alleged killing of two patients by police. The charity said it was aware of activity at its Guatemalan offices, and deny any wrongdoing. Scientists say tourists don't understand the dangers when they sign up for hiking trips.

        "long_description": "Stargazers around the globe were treated to a stunning celestial scene on Friday as Venus appeared shining brightly above a crescent Moon. The planet was visible to the naked eye from the UK to the US, Turkey and China. Venus is often called the Evening Star or Morning Star because, when it is prominent, it appears like the brightest \"star\" in the sky. More astronomical delights are expected this new year, as January 2025 is going to be a good month to spot both Venus and Saturn. Make sure to take a look up into the sky on 18 January, as those planets will be appear just 2.2\u00b0 apart. Stargazers may also be able to spot shooting stars blazing across the skies, as the Quadrantid meteor shower continues. This shower, which is expected to peak on Saturday, has been visible since 26 December and will continue until 12 January. Dr Robert Massey, deputy director of the Royal Astronomical Society in the UK, said observers hoping to catch a glimpse of the celestial fireworks after sunset will need to get \"as far away from light pollution as possible\". \"If you have the time to look out and the weather is good, then do take a look because it's a perfect new year treat.\" Scientists hope the probe can help us better understand how the Sun works. Many stars in our galaxy exist in pairs. Now scientists are finding clues that our Sun may once have had a companion of its own. The question is, where did it go? The hope is the probe could help us to better understand how the Sun works. The Geminids are an astronomical highlight of the year, creating a spectacular show of shooting stars every December. Scientists are now starting to understand where they came from. Nick Hewitt hopes the Geminid meteor shower will inspire more of us to discover the night sky's wonders. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "title": "After bruising election loss, what next for Kamala Harris?",
        "short_description": "Exactly two months after her election loss to Donald Trump, Vice-President Kamala Harris will preside over the certification of her own defeat.",
        "long_description": "Exactly two months after her election loss to Donald Trump, Vice-President Kamala Harris will preside over the certification of her own defeat. As president of the Senate, on Monday she will stand at the House Speaker's rostrum to lead the counting of Electoral College votes, officially cementing her rival's triumph two weeks before he returns to the White House. The circumstances are painful and awkward for a candidate who decried her opponent as an urgent threat to American democracy, but Harris aides insist she will conduct her constitutional and legal duty with seriousness and grace. It is not the first time a losing candidate will lead the joint session of Congress to count their opponent's presidential electors - Al Gore endured the indignity in 2001 and Richard Nixon in 1961. But it's a fitting coda to an improbable election that saw Harris elevated from a back-up to the nation's oldest president to the Democratic standard bearer - whose fleeting campaign provided a jolt of hope to her party before a crushing loss exposed deep internal faultlines. Harris and her team are now deliberating her second act, and weighing whether it includes another run for the White House in 2028 or pursuing a bid for the governor's mansion in her home state of California. While recent Democratic candidates who lost elections - Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton - have decided against seeking the presidency again, aides, allies and donors argue that the groundswell of support Harris captured in her unsuccessful bid and the unusual circumstances of her condensed campaign proves there's still scope for her to seek the Oval Office. They even point to Donald Trump's own circuitous political path - the former and future president's bookend wins in 2016 and 2024, despite losing as the incumbent in 2020. But while many Democrats do not blame Harris for Trump's win, some - stung by a bruising loss that has called the party's strategy into question - are deeply sceptical of giving her another shot at the White House. A host of Democratic governors who coalesced behind the vice-president in 2024 but have ambitions of their own are seen by some strategists as fresher candidates with a much better chance of winning. Harris herself is said to be in no rush to make any decisions, telling advisers and supporters she is open to all the possibilities that await her after Inauguration Day on 20 January. She is assessing the last few months, which saw her launch an entirely new White House campaign, vet a running-mate, lead a party convention and barnstorm the country in just 107 days. And aides point out that she remains the US vice-president, at least for another two weeks. \"She has a decision to make and you can't make it when you're still on the treadmill. It may have slowed down \u2013 but she's on the treadmill until 20 January,\" said Donna Brazile, a close Harris ally who advised the campaign. \"You can't put anyone in a box. We didn't put Al Gore in a box and it was obvious the country was very divided after the 2000 election,\" said Brazile, who ran Gore's campaign against George W Bush and pointed to his second life as an environmental activist. \"All options are on the table because there's an appetite for change and I do believe that she can represent that change in the future.\" But the nagging question that shadows any potential 2028 run is whether the 60-year-old can separate herself from Joe Biden - something she failed to do in the election campaign. Her allies in the party say that Biden's choice to seek re-election despite worries about his age, only then to ultimately drop out of the race with months to go, doomed her candidacy. Though Trump swept all seven battleground states and is the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote, his margin of victory was relatively narrow while Harris still won 75 million votes, an outcome her supporters argue can't be ignored as a currently faceless Democratic party rebuilds over the next four years. On the other side, those close to Biden remain convinced he could have defeated Trump again, despite surveys showing he had been bleeding support from key Democratic voting blocs. They point out that Harris fell short where the president didn't in 2020, underperforming with core Democratic groups like black and Latino voters. Critics continue to bring up her 2019 campaign to become the Democratic presidential nominee, which sputtered out in less than a year. \"People forget that had there been a real primary [in 2024], she never would have been the nominee. Everyone knows that,\" said one former Biden adviser. The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, applauded Harris for reviving the Democratic base and helping key congressional races, but said Trump's campaign successfully undercut her on critical campaign issues including the economy and the border. Members of Trump's team, however, including his chief pollster, have acknowledged that Harris performed stronger as a candidate than Biden on certain issues like the economy among voters. Yet there's no escaping that any Democratic primary contest for 2028 would be a tough fight, with rising stars like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and California Governor Gavin Newsom already weighing presidential runs. Some Democrats say that Harris would nonetheless start ahead of the pack, with national name recognition, a much-coveted mailing list and a deep bench of volunteers. \"What state party would not want her to come help them set the table for the 2026 midterm elections?\" Brazile said. \"She's going to have plenty opportunities not only to rebuild, but to strengthen the coalition that came together to support her in 2024.\" Others have suggested she could step out of the political arena entirely, running a foundation or establishing an institute of politics at her alma mater, Howard University, the Washington-based historically black college where she held her election night party. The former top state prosecutor could also be a contender for secretary of state or attorney general in a future Democratic administration. And she'll need to decide if she wants to write another book. For all of her options, Harris has told aides, she wants to remain visible and be seen as a leader in the party. One adviser suggested that she could exist outside the domestic political fray, taking on a more global role on an issue that matters to her, but that's a difficult perch without a platform as large as the vice-presidency. In the waning days of the Biden-Harris administration, she plans to embark on an international trip to multiple regions, according to a source familiar with the plans, signalling her desire to maintain a role on the world stage and build a legacy beyond being Biden's number two. For Harris and her team, the weeks since the election have been humbling, a mix of grief and resolve. Several aides described the three-month sprint that began when Biden dropped out as having begun with the campaign \"digging out of a hole\" and ending with their candidate more popular than when she began, even if she didn't win. \"There's a sense of peace knowing that given the hand we were dealt, we ran through the tape,\" said one senior aide. Following the election, Harris and her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, spent a week in Hawaii with a small group of aides to relax and discuss her future. During a staff holiday party at her official residence before Christmas, Harris recounted election night and how she delivered a pep talk to her family as the results became clear. \"We are not having a pity party!\" she told the crowd of her reaction that night. Advisers and allies say she is still processing what happened, and wants to wait and see how the new administration unfolds in January before staking out any position, let alone seeking to become the face of any so-called Trump \"resistance\". Democrats have found the resistance movement that took off among liberals in the wake of his 2016 win no longer resonates in today's political climate, where the Republican has proven that his message and style appeals to a huge cross-section of Americans. They have adopted a more conciliatory approach in confronting the incoming president's agenda. As several Democrats put it: \"What resistance?\" Though she's kept a relatively low profile since her loss, Harris provided a glimpse of her mindset at an event for students at Prince George's Community College in Maryland in December. \"The movements for civil rights, women's rights, workers' rights, the United States of America itself, would never have come to be if people had given up their cause after a court case, or a battle, or an election did not go their way,\" she said. \"We must stay in the fight,\" she added, a refrain she has repeated since her 2016 Senate win. \"Everyone of us.\" What that means is less clear. For some donors and supporters, staying \"in the fight\" could translate to a run for California governor in 2026, when a term-limited Gavin Newsom will step down and potentially pursue his own White House ambitions. The job, leading the world's fifth-largest economy, would also put Harris in direct conflict with Trump, who has regularly assailed the state for its left-leaning policies. But governing a major state is no small feat, and would derail any presidential run, as she would be sworn into office about the same time she would need to launch a national campaign. Those who have spoken to Harris said she remains undecided about the governor's race, which some allies have described as a potential \"capstone\" to her career. She has won statewide office three times as California's attorney general and later as a US senator. But a gubernatorial win would give her another historic honour - becoming the nation's first black female governor. Still, some allies acknowledge it would be difficult to transition from being inside a 20-car motorcade and having a seat across the table from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the governor's mansion. The private sector is another option. \"For women at other levels of office, when they lose an election, sometimes options are not as available to them compared to men, who get a soft landing at a law firm or insurance business, and it gives them a place to take a beat, make some money and then make decisions about what's next,\" said Debbie Walsh, director for the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \"I don't think that's going to be a problem for Kamala Harris. I think doors will open for her if she wants to open them.\" But for Harris, who has been in elected office for two decades, and worked as a public prosecutor before that, an afterlife as governor may be the most fitting option. \"When you've had one client \u2013 the people \u2013 for the entirety of your career,\" said one former adviser, \"where do you go from here?\" Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans. The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The suspect used an \u201cimprovised incendiary device\u201d to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election. A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds. Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years. The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power. Given all the things they\u2019ve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump\u2019s meeting could be really awkward. 'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton. The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him. The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory. After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign. The BBC's Samira Hussain was on the ground for Harris's concession speech at Howard University. The vice-president addressed supporters at Howard University in Washington DC, following her election defeat to Donald Trump. BBC NI asks people in Belfast how they feel about Donald Trump's victory in the US election. Donald Trump took the stage at his campaign watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was met with loud cheers. Voters across the US have their say on the re-election of Donald Trump. Sir Keir Stamer and Kemi Badenoch react to Donald Trump's US Election victory at PMQs. The first minister had backed Democrat Kamala Harris, which Trump's Scottish business had branded \"an insult\". Catch up on the key moments from election night. The Republican nominee for vice president JD Vance addresses a rally of Donald Trump supporters. The Republicans' slim House majority faced an early test with the re-election of Speaker Mike Johnson. The junior senator from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and morphed from a 'never-Trumper' into a Maga champion. Cracks have appeared among Trump supporters over the stand taken by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The Republican will begin his second presidential term in January 2025.

        "long_description": "January 4, 2025 11:15 am The Public Health Veterinary Service reports that nearly 300,000 dog bites are recorded annually in Sri Lanka, leading to the administration of approximately 200,000 human rabies vaccines last year. According to Dr. Yeshan Guruge, Medical Officer of the Public Health Veterinary Service, 20 people succumbed to rabies last year. Among these fatalities, 11 were attributed to dog bites, one to a Golden palm civet bite, while in eight cases, the animal responsible could not be properly identified. Middle-aged individuals are the primary victims of animal bites, with men accounting for half of the cases. Despite dog bites being the most common cause, their frequency has shown a gradual decline over the past decade. However, bites from toque macaque monkeys have increased during this period. Dr. Guruge also highlighted that over Rs. 600 million is spent annually on human rabies vaccines in Sri Lanka.",

        "title": "Israeli strikes kill at least 30 in Gaza as ceasefire talks set to resume in Qatar",
        "short_description": "January 3, 2025 10:08 pm",
        "long_description": "January 3, 2025 10:08 pm Israeli strikes killed at least 30 people in Gaza, including children, overnight and into Friday, hospital staff said, as often-stalled ceasefire talks to end the Israel-Hamas war were set to resume in Qatar. Sirens sounded across Israel for missiles fired from Yemen. Staff at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said that more than a dozen women and children were killed in strikes in central Gaza, including in Nuseirat, Zawaida, Maghazi and Deir al-Balah. Dozens of people were killed across the enclave the previous day, bringing the total killed in the past 24 hours to 56. \u201cWe woke up to the missile strike. We found the whole house disintegrated,\u201d Abdul Rahman Al-Nabrisi said in the Maghazi refugee camp. The Israeli army said in a statement Friday that during the past day, it had struck dozens of Hamas gathering points and command centers throughout Gaza. The army asserted that measures were taken to mitigate civilian harm, such as using aerial surveillance. And it issued a warning for people to leave an area of central Gaza immediately, saying it would attack following launches from there toward Israel. The military said that a few projectiles entered Israel from central and northern Gaza, with no injuries reported. Freelance journalist Omar al-Derawi was among those killed on Friday. Associated Press reporters saw friends and colleagues mourning over his body, with a press vest laid on his shroud. The Committee to Protect Journalists said last month that more than 130 Palestinian reporters have been killed since the start of the war. Israel hasn\u2019t allowed foreign journalists to enter Gaza except on military embeds. Israelis also woke up to attacks. Israel said that missiles were fired into the country from Yemen, setting off air raid sirens in Jerusalem and central Israel and sending people scrambling to shelters. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Israel\u2019s army said that a missile was intercepted. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen often claim responsibility. Efforts at ceasefire negotiations were expected to resume Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office has said that he authorized a delegation from the Mossad intelligence agency, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the military to continue negotiations in Qatar. The delegation was leaving for Qatar on Friday. The U.S.-led talks have repeatedly stalled during nearly 15 months of war. Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed. But the militants, while greatly weakened, have repeatedly regrouped, often after Israeli forces withdraw from areas. The war was sparked by Hamas-led militants\u2019 attack into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. Israel\u2019s offensive in retaliation has killed more than 45,500 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the dead. The ministry doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally. Israel\u2019s military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea. Source: AP --Agencies",

Tomiko Itooka died in a nursing home in the city of Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, according to officials. She became the oldest person in the world after Spain\u2019s Maria Branyas Morera passed away in August 2024 at age 117. \u201cMs Itooka gave us courage and hope through her long life,\u201d Ashiya\u2019s 27-year-old mayor Ryosuke Takashima said in a statement. \u201cWe thank her for it.\u201d Ms Itooka was born in May 1908 \u2013 six years before the World War One and the same year that the Ford Model T car was launched in the US. She was verified as the world\u2019s oldest person in September 2024 and was presented with the official GWR certificate on the Respect for the Aged Day, which is a Japanese public holiday celebrated annually to honour the country\u2019s elderly citizens. Ms Itooka, who was one of three siblings, lived through world wars and pandemics as well as technological breakthroughs. As a student, she played volleyball and climbed the 3,067-metre (10,062-foot) Mount Ontake twice. In her older age, she enjoyed bananas and Calpis, a milky soft drink popular in Japan, according to the mayor\u2019s statement. She married at 20, and had two daughters and two sons, according to Guinness. During World War Two she managed the office of her husband\u2019s textile factory. She lived alone in Nara after her husband died in 1979. She is survived by one son and one daughter, and five grandchildren. A funeral service was held with family and friends, according to officials. As of September, Japan counted more than 95,000 people who were 100 or older - 88% of whom were women. Of the country\u2019s 124 million people, nearly a third are 65 or older. Brazilian nun Inah Canabarro Lucas, who was born 16 days after Itooka and is 116, is now believed to be the world\u2019s oldest person. Source: BBC --Agencies",
