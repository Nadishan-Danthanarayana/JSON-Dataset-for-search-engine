        "short_description": "Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico has threatened to cut financial support for more than 130,000 Ukrainian refugees as a dispute with Ukraine over Russian gas supplies escalates.",
        "long_description": "Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico has threatened to cut financial support for more than 130,000 Ukrainian refugees as a dispute with Ukraine over Russian gas supplies escalates. On 1 January, Kyiv shut off a pipeline that for decades was used to supply Central Europe with Russian natural gas. Slovakia had been the main entry point and the country now stands to lose millions of euros in transit fees. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) estimated last month that there were 130,530 Ukrainian refugees in Slovakia out of 6,813,900 globally. Fico - who in December made a surprise visit to Moscow for talks with Russia's President Vladimir Putin - described Kyiv's move as \"sabotage\". The prime minister of the EU state said he would propose halting electricity exports to Ukraine and also \"sharply reducing\" financial support for Ukrainians who have found shelter in Slovakia. He said there was no risk of Slovakia itself suffering from gas shortages, as it had already made alternative arrangements. But Fico added that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's decision to turn off the taps would deprive Slovakia of 500m euros (\u00a3415m; $518m) in transit fees from other countries. He said his party was ready to debate \"halting supplies of electricity\" and the \"significant lowering of support for Ukrainian citizens in Slovakia\". \"The only alternative for a sovereign Slovakia is renewal of transit or demanding compensation mechanisms that will replace the loss in public finances,\" he added. Last month Zelensky accused Fico of helping Putin to \"fund the war and weaken Ukraine\". \"Fico is dragging Slovakia into Russia's attempts to cause more suffering for Ukrainians,\" the Ukrainian president had said. Poland has offered to support Kyiv in case Slovakia cuts off its electricity exports - supplies that are crucial to Ukraine, whose power plants come under regular attack from Russia. Poland's government called Ukraine's shutdown of Russian gas supplies \"another victory\" against Moscow while the European Commission said the EU had prepared for the change and most states could cope. Moldova, which is not in the EU, is already suffering shortages. Russia can still send gas to Hungary, Turkey and Serbia through the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea. Russian gas has stopped passing through Ukraine after a five-year deal expired, leaving Moldova at risk of a crisis. Navy personnel from Devon and Cornwall were called on Christmas Day for a five-day operation. The country is home to the biggest remaining contingent of French troops in the region. People in Moscow speak to BBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg about their wishes for the New Year. Moscow said 150 Russians were released while Zelensky said 189 Ukrainians had returned home.

        "long_description": "US authorities have said they believe multiple people were involved in an attack in New Orleans that killed 15 and wounded dozens on New Year's Day. The driver of a pick-up truck that sped into large crowds in the city's French Quarter has been identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a US Army veteran from Texas, who was later killed in a shootout with police. CCTV footage shows people running to escape as the attack took place. The suspect, who stole a package off a front porch, returned days later after the victim shared footage of the theft on an app. The US president-elect recently referred to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the \"governor\" of the \"Great State of Canada\". The damaged pipeline sparked a massive fire prompting road closures and emergency responses. Two people were fatally shot and several injured during a school shooting in Madison, Wisconsin. BBC Verify looks at claims about the involvement of aliens or foreign state actors in the alleged drone sightings. US officials have said there is no evidence the drones pose a national security or public safety threat. At least four people were injured, with cars flipped and trees downed after the tornado tore through Scotts Valley. None of first responders were injured, but the truck driver was taken to the hospital for minor injuries. Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency due to the severe weather. A police chase in Massachusetts has ended with a man needing to be rescued by the detectives he was fleeing. The Oscar, Tony and Olivier Award-nominated British actor is honoured on Tinseltown's boulevard of stars. Four people, including the pilot, have been taken to hospital in Victoria, Texas. People in New York weigh-in on the conclusion of the fatal subway chokehold case and whether they feel safe on the city's transit system. Larry had been joking with his friends about a man who looked like the suspect. The blaze has burned more than 300 acres with a \"rapid rate of spread\", say authorities. The 26-year-old was taken into custody at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, in connection to the killing of United Health CEO Brian Thompson.

        "short_description": "Just hours before the clock struck midnight on New Year's Eve, Jack Bech got on a phone call with his older brother Martin - an avid outdoorsman and former football star mostly known to friends and teammates as \"Tiger\".",
        "long_description": "Just hours before the clock struck midnight on New Year's Eve, Jack Bech got on a phone call with his older brother Martin - an avid outdoorsman and former football star mostly known to friends and teammates as \"Tiger\". Jack, 22, was in Dallas visiting family members, while Tiger, a 28-year-old former Princeton alumnus who lived in New York, was in New Orleans, getting ready to celebrate the New Year. \"We just thought it was going to be another conversation,\" he told the BBC. \"I was showing him what we were eating, and he was showing us what he was eating.\" The two brothers would never speak again. \"I hung up the phone, and that was the last time I ever spoke with him,\" Jack recalled. Tiger was among the 14 people killed when an attacker ploughed through a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans. The attacker, 42-year-old army veteran Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was killed in a gunfight with police after he drove a pick-up truck into the crowds, according to authorities. Though he posted videos online proclaiming allegiance to the Islamic State group before the attack, FBI officials said they believe he was acting alone. While the identities of all the victims have not been made public yet, a picture is slowly emerging of a group of mostly young people, many of whom - like Tiger - were Louisiana locals. Jack - who remembers his brother as his best friend, role model and inspiration - says that the close-knit Bech family will never be the same. Most of the family is in the town of Lafayette, about 136 miles (218km) away from New Orleans. \"This is something we're going to have to deal with. Every time we wake up, and every time we go to sleep, it's going to be something,\" he added. \"Every holiday, there's going to be an empty seat at the table.\" But Tiger said that his brother \"wouldn't want us to grieve and mourn\". Instead, he has encouraged his family to remember him as \"a fighter\". \"He'd want us to keep attacking life...he'd want us to go and be there for each other,\" he said. \"I told my family that instead of seeing him a couple of times a year, he'll be with us every moment,\" Jack added. \"Whenever we're waking up and we're going to sleep and we're walking, when we're at work, doing whatever, he'll be with us.\" Among the other victims of the attack in the early morning hours of 1 January was Matthew Tenedorio, an audio-visual technician at New Orleans' Caesars' Superdome. Tenedorio, who just turned 25 in October, had spent the earlier part of his evening at his brother's home in the town of Slidell, about 35 minutes away from New Orleans. With him were his father and mother - who just recently recovered from cancer. His cousin, Christina Bounds, told the BBC that his family \"begged\" him not to go into New Orleans, fearful of the large crowd and potential dangers. Despite their pleas, he went, along with two friends. When the news broke, his mother eventually got a hold of one of them. \"They said they were walking down Bourbon, and saw a body fall,\" she said, noting that they now believe it was a body thrown into the air by the attacker's truck. Amid screams and gunshots, Tenedorio was separated from his friends. His family says he was shot, and believe he was killed during the exchange of gunfire between the attacker and police officers on Bourbon Street. The BBC is unable to independently verify this claim. According to Ms Bounds, the family's tragedy has been made more painful by the slow, nearly non-existent trickle of communications they've had with local authorities. \"We couldn't get any information when my aunt [Tenedorio's mother, Cathy] showed up at the hospital,\" she said. \"There has been no information from doctors, hospitals, or cops. Nobody.\" \"They have zero information, and that's the part that's pissing everybody off. We don't even know what happened,\" Bounds added. \"Was he carried out by the EMS? Was he in an ambulance? Did he die instantly?\" These answers, she added, would \"help people accept\" what happened. \"But now it's like total shock,\" she added. \"It's not registering.\" The family has started a GoFundMe page to gather funds for Tenedorio's funeral expenses - which Ms Bounds said have been made difficult by his mother's significant medical bills during her cancer diagnosis. Another cousin of Tenedorio's, Zach Colgan, remembers him as a \"goofball\" who was quick to make a joke, cared deeply about animals and was an avid storyteller. \"He cared. He was definitely a people person. A happy-go-lucky guy,\" Mr Colgan told the BBC. \"It's sad that a terrorist attack took him...no family should ever have to bury their son, especially for something so senseless.\" Mr Colgan, who has experience working with law enforcement in Louisiana, says he believes officers have done the best they can in an extremely hectic casualty situation. \"I know it's chaotic. But part of closure is getting answers. I know my aunt and uncle weren't able to get much besides 'yes - Matthew was killed',\" he said. \"It'd be nice to know a little bit more,\" Mr Colgan added. \"\"If it was my kid, I'd want to know.\" Even as his family continues to search for answers, Mr Colgan says he hopes that the government and public's focus continues to be on the victims, rather than on law enforcement's response or what else could have been done to prevent the attack. \"I want every single one of them to be remembered,\" he said. \"They didn't deserve this. No one deserves this.\" Police say that 18 people were injured in the deadly crash in the city of Fullerton, California. A whale that famously pushed its calf's dead body for 17 days in 2018 appears to be grieving again. Las Vegas police say the driver of the burned vehicle is US Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger of Colorado. People partake in a moment of silence to remember the victims of Wednesday's deadly attack.

        "long_description": "Las Vegas police have identified Matthew Alan Livelsberger as the man they believe to have been inside the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded in front of the Trump International Hotel on Wednesday. They say Livelsberger, an active-duty US special forces soldier, rented the vehicle and drove it from Las Vegas from Colorado. The case and motive of the explosion is still under investigation, but parallels have been drawn between the subject in the Cybertruck explosion and the suspect involved in the New Orleans attack on New Year's Day.

He gestures towards Jason who is holding a large fish. \"No one will go hungry in this camp tonight,\" Bryn adds. The film then cuts and he asks: \"Enjoy your soup?\" What else happened? Perhaps what happens on fishing trips should stay on fishing trips. The number of children playing has doubled in a year, says the body representing the junior game.

Medics scrambled to the scene but made the \"difficult decision\" to put down the animal. Melanie Walters, who plays Gwen West in the series, says the joke was \"never written in as a thing\". The extreme weather left damage and destruction in its path when it struck. It started with a text message phone alert warning of what was to come. BBC reporter Oli Constable describes the scene in the coastal city of Bangor. A rare red weather warning is in place in Wales and south-west England as Storm Darragh hits. Flights are grounded, roads are closed and homes are without power because of the storm. A red weather warning has been issued - the same level as that given for 2018's Beast from the East. Cranes have been brought in to stabilise the chasm, now 17ft (5.2m) wide. The high level alert predicts dangerous and potentially life-threatening weather across 13 counties.

        "short_description": "Former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg is to step down from his current job as president of global affairs at social media giant Meta.",
        "long_description": "Former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg is to step down from his current job as president of global affairs at social media giant Meta. In a post on Meta's Facebook on Thursday, Sir Nick, a former leader of the Liberal Democrats, said he was departing the company after nearly seven years. He will be replaced by his current deputy and Republican Joe Kaplan, who previously served as deputy chief of staff in the White House during President George W Bush's administration, and is known for handling the company's relations with Republicans. He added that he would spend \"a few months handing over the reins\" and representing Facebook at international gatherings before moving on to \"new adventures\". Sir Nick's resignation comes just weeks before Donald Trump returns to the White House. The president-elect has repeatedly accused Meta and other platforms of censorship and silencing conservative speech. His relations with Mr Zuckerberg have been particularly strained, after Facebook and Instagram suspended the former president's accounts for two years in 2021, after they said he praised those engaged in violence at the Capitol on 6 January. More recently, Trump threatened to imprison Mr Zuckerberg if he interfered in the 2024 election, and even called Facebook an \"enemy of the people\" in March. However tensions appear to be thawing between the two, with the pair dining at Trump's Florida estate in Mar-a-Lago since the US election. Mr Zuckerberg also congratulated him on his victory and donated $1m (\u00a3786,000) to an inauguration fund. Sir Nick's departure is seen by some analysts as a nod to the changing of the guard in Washington. He joined Facebook in 2018, after losing his seat as an MP in 2017. He was later promoted to president of global affairs, a prominent position at Meta. He was instrumental in launching Meta's oversight board, a panel of experts that makes decisions and advises Mr Zuckerberg on policies around content moderation, privacy, and other issues. Sir Nick has been open about his views on Trump's close ally, Elon Musk, describing him as a political puppet master, claiming he has turned X, formerly Twitter, into a \"one-man hyper-partisan hobby horse\". The former Liberal Democrat leader moved to Silicon Valley initially but returned to London in 2022. In his statement, he said he was moving on to \"new adventures\" with \"immense gratitude and pride\" at what he had been part of. He said: \"My time at the company coincided with a significant resetting of the relationship between 'big tech' and the societal pressures manifested in new laws, institutions and norms affecting the sector. \"I hope I have played some role in seeking to bridge the very different worlds of tech and politics \u2013 worlds that will continue to interact in unpredictable ways across the globe.\" He added: \"I am simply thrilled that my deputy, Joel Kaplan, will now become Meta's chief global affairs officer\u2026He is quite clearly the right person for the right job at the right time!\" When I left my late grandmother's necklace on a bus, a group of internet strangers helped me get it back. New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site The long-awaited decision follows a standoff with Meta, and succeeds a world-first law from 2021. Over 22,000 people reported issues with Facebook on Wednesday evening and over 18,000 struggled to use WhatsApp, according to Downdetector. The former deputy PM turned top Meta boss tells Nick Robinson that Musk is playing an \"outsized\" role in US politics. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

        "title": "Sweden's green industry hopes hit by Northvolt woes",
        "short_description": "Heavy snow blends into white thick clouds in Skellefte\u00e5, a riverside city in northern Sweden that is home to 78,000 residents.",
        "long_description": "Heavy snow blends into white thick clouds in Skellefte\u00e5, a riverside city in northern Sweden that is home to 78,000 residents. It's also the location of what was supposed to become Europe's biggest and greenest electric battery factory, powered by the region's abundance of renewable energy. Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania. But it ran into major financial troubles last year, reporting debts of $5.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in November, and filing for bankruptcy in the US, where it had been hoping to expand its operations. Since September it's laid off around a quarter of its global workforce including more than 1,000 staff in Skellefte\u00e5. \"A lot of people have moved out already,\" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefte\u00e5 for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden. \"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\" Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs). In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices. Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis. \"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet. At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians. But this \"now-or-never\" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that \"never finished attracting investment\". Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans. The firm has hired German Marcus Dangelmaier, from global electronics company TE Connectivity to run Northvolt's operations in Skellefe\u00e5, from January, as it seeks to attract fresh investment. Northvolt's co-founder and CEO Peter Carlsson \u2013 a former Tesla executive \u2013 resigned in November. As the postmortem into the crisis continues, there are debates about the potential impact on Sweden's green ambitions. Northern Sweden, dubbed the \"Nordic Silicon Valley of sustainability\" by consultancy firm McKinsey, has swiftly gained global reputation for new industries designed to fast-track Europe's green transition. The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free fuel using hydrogen. But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's \"very good brand\" when it comes to green technologies. \"There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,\" he says. Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact. \"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt. Headquartered in Malm\u00f6 in southern Sweden, Cleantech for Nordics is an organisation that represents a coalition of 15 major investors in sustainability-focussed start-ups. Here, climate policy analyst Eva Andersson believes the nation's long legacy as an environmental champion will remain relevant. \"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues. Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023. Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%. \"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson. There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash. \"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson. Just 3% of global battery cell production currently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market. Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer. Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector. But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs. \"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\" The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview. Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow. He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being \"not as ambitious\" as previous administrations. The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO. \"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\" Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources). \"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin. Plans to buy locally generated power may breach government guidelines. Huge infrastructure projects are planned for East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, despite local opposition. There are plans to build five solar farms in Norfolk, including one that would be the UK's largest. An energy firm says it is disappointed and will consider its next steps. Police say they are investigating a murder after a man was shot dead in Norrk\u00f6ping. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism. General news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines. Article bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found. BBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories: News - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources Analysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trends Ask the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience response Explainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the news Opinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and data Review - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion Our output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language. We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Where BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on. Whenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment. For in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods. \u00c2\u00a9 2025 BBC.

        "long_description": "A South Korean man accused of being responsible for a cryptocurrency crisis which cost investors $40bn (\u00a331.8bn) has finally been extradited to the United States. Do Kwon was the boss of Terraform, which operated two cryptocurrencies - TerraUSD and Luna - both of which collapsed in 2022, sparking a wider sell-off in the crypto market. The US says he was responsible for the coins' failure, accusing him of \"orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud\". Kwon fled South Korea after a warrant for his arrest was issued, eventually ending up in Montenegro where he has now been extradited from, following a lengthy legal battle. He was previously found guilty of forging documents by a Montenegro court, having been arrested as he was attempting to board a plane to Dubai in March 2023. It had been unclear whether he would face criminal proceedings in the US, however, as Montenegro does not have extradition treaties with the US or South Korea, which has also been seeking his extradition. Kwon finally being sent to the US brings to an end legal proceedings that lasted more than 18 months. The Montenegrin Ministry of Justice approved the extradition earlier in December. It claimed that Do Kwon had also agreed to it. Kwon's firm Terraform Labs became widely known in 2021, when its coins Luna and TerraUSD exploded in popularity. Fans of Luna became known as \"Lunatics\", with Kwon referred to as their \"king\". But, despite a huge amount of money being poured into the coins, on 9 May 2022 Terraform Labs collapsed catastrophically, losing more than 99% of its value in 48 hours. Investors scrambled to take their money out of other cryptocurrencies, fearing that a similar thing could happen to them, which resulted in values falling significantly across the whole sector. It's estimated the so-called \"cryptocrash\" resulted in losses of $400bn (\u00a3318 bn). Bitcoin was among the assets affected, however it has significantly grown in value since then and briefly stood at more than $100,000 per coin in December. Terraform Labs ultimately filed for bankruptcy in the US in January 2024. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

        "title": "Tesla sales stall as China's BYD closes in",
        "short_description": "Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade, as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
        "long_description": "Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade, as demand faltered and rivals gained pace. The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered almost 1.79 million cars last year, down about 1% from 1.8 million in 2023. This comes despite the company lowering prices repeatedly last year in a bid to woo buyers and hold on to its rank as the world's top-selling maker of electric vehicles (EVs). China's BYD, however, looks set to close the gap after reporting 1.76 million EV sales in 2024. The Shenzhen-based firm's total vehicle sales jumped more than 41% in 2024, year-on-year, to more than 4.2 million. The surge was powered mainly by sales of its hybrid cars. BYD sells 90% of its cars in China, where it has been extending its lead over foreign brands including Volkswagen and Toyota. It has benefited from a rise in car sales in its home market, as intense competition drove down prices and government subsidies encouraged consumers to replace their old cars with EVs or other more fuel efficient options. Tesla also counts China as a key market, but it has lost ground to rivals as the price war rumbles on. Demand for electric vehicles has also softened in other regions, such as the US and Europe, creating challenges for many carmakers. Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors were among the companies that cut sales targets or decided to delay investments in EV technology last year. At Tesla, its boss Elon Musk has blamed weaker sales in part on the jump in borrowing costs since 2022, which has made it more expensive to buy. Analysts have also pointed to increased competition and questions about the brand, as Musk deepens his political involvement, which has been described as controversial. Tesla sales slumped in the first half of 2024 before starting to pick up again. In the final three months of 2024, it delivered about 495,000 cars, up 2% year-on-year and a quarterly record. But the firm's share price, which surged more than 60% last year, fell 5% in morning trade, as the figure came in below the roughly 500,000 forecast by analysts. \"If you don't meet expectations, it can be pretty tough out there,\" said Christopher Carey of the Carnegie Investment Council. Last month, Honda and Nissan confirmed that they were holding merger talks, as the two Japanese firms seek to fight back against competition from the Chinese car industry. Earlier in the month, the boss of car making giant Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, quit with immediate effect following a boardroom clash. His abrupt exit from the company - which owns brands including Vauxhall, Jeep, Fiat, Peugeot and Chrysler - came two months after Stellantis issued a profit warning. Some governments have stepped in to protect domestic companies. In October, European Union tariffs of up to 45.3% on imports of Chinese-made EVs came into force across the trade bloc. The US has also imposed a 100% duty on EVs from China and President-elect Donald Trump is expected to impose further tariffs on imports. BYD has still been expanding its foothold in emerging economies. But last month, it faced a setback in Brazil - its largest overseas market - with authorities halting the construction of a BYD factory, saying workers lived in conditions comparable to \"slavery\". BYD said it had cut ties with the construction firm involved and remained committed to a \"full compliance with Brazilian legislation\". The BBC's Lily Jamali reports from outside the Trump International Hotel where the explosion took place. Concerns are raised about the government ability to hit emissions targets following the decision New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site The government says it will \"restore clarity\" for vehicle manufacturers and the charging industry. More than 160 workers have been rescued from the car factory, according to local prosecutors. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

        "title": "Era of cheap Russian gas to EU ends as transit across Ukraine stops",
        "short_description": "Russian gas has stopped flowing to EU states via Ukraine after a five-year deal expired, marking the end of a decades-long arrangement.",
        "long_description": "Russian gas has stopped flowing to EU states via Ukraine after a five-year deal expired, marking the end of a decades-long arrangement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that his country would not allow Russia to \"earn additional billions on our blood\". Poland's government meanwhile said the cut-off was \"another victory\" against Moscow. The European Commission said the EU had prepared for the change and most states could cope. Moldova, which is not in the EU, is already suffering shortages. Russia can still send gas to Hungary, Turkey and Serbia through the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea. Russian company Gazprom confirmed that gas exports via Ukraine to Europe stopped from 08:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Moscow has transported gas to Europe through Ukraine since 1991. While immediate effects are light, the strategic and symbolic impact for the whole of Europe is enormous. Russia has lost an important market, but its president, Vladimir Putin, says EU countries will suffer most. The EU has significantly reduced imports of gas from Russia since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but a number of eastern member states still depend largely on the supplies, making Russia about \u20ac5bn ($5.2bn; \u00a34.2bn) a year. Russian gas was less than 10% of the EU's gas imports in 2023, according to the bloc. That figure was 40% in 2021. But several EU members, including Slovakia and Austria, continued to import significant amounts of gas from Russia. Austria's energy regulator said that it did not forecast any disruption as it had diversified sources and built up reserves. But the end of the transit deal has already caused serious tensions with Slovakia, which is now the main entry point of Russian gas into the EU and earned transit fees from piping the gas on to Austria, Hungary and Italy. Slovakia has said it will pay more for alternative routes. Its energy regulator announced in early December that Gas prices for consumers would rise in 2025. Robert Fico, Slovakia's prime minister, said on Wednesday that the end of the deal would have \"drastic\" consequences for EU countries, but not on Russia, Reuters reported. On Friday, Fico - who had just made a surprise visit to Moscow for talks with Putin - threatened to stop supplying electricity to Ukraine. This prompted Zelensky to accuse Fico of helping Putin \"fund the war and weaken Ukraine\". \"Fico is dragging Slovakia into Russia's attempts to cause more suffering for Ukrainians,\" the Ukrainian president said. Poland has offered to support Kyiv in case Slovakia cuts off its electricity exports - supplies that are crucial to Ukraine, whose power plants come under regular attack from Russia. Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were alternative gas supply routes from international markets, such as a terminal in Croatia and connections from Germany and Poland. \"These routes should be explored so that Russia doesn't make money on selling oil and gas to the European Union,\" Sikorski said. Poland is importing gas from the US, Qatar and the North Sea, he added. \"As far as I understand, all countries have alternative routes,\" he said. Moldova - which is not part of the EU - could be seriously affected by the end of the transit agreement. It generates much of its electricity at a power station fuelled by Russian gas. It also supplied the Russia-backed breakaway region of Transnistria, a small sliver of land sandwiched between Moldova and Ukraine where around 300,000 people live. Russian gas company Gazprom had said on 28 December it would restrict gas to Moldova on 1 January because it said it had failed to fulfil its payment obligations. Dorin Recean, Moldova's prime minister, denied the alleged debt and accused Russia of using \"energy as a political weapon\" in a social media post. He said the move would leave Transnistria \"without light and heat in the middle of the winter\". Heat and hot water was cut off to Transnistria \"due to the temporary cessation of gas supplies\" at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday, energy company Tirasteploenergo said on Telegram. It urged residents to dress warmly, gather family members together in a single room, hang blankets or thick curtains over windows, and use electric heaters. The temperature was due to drop below 0C on Wednesday night. Medical institutions and hospitals were still being supplied, the company said. Moldova's energy minister, Constantin Borosan, said his government had taken steps to ensure stable power supplies, but called on citizens to save energy. A 60-day state of emergency in the energy sector has been in place since mid-December. President Maia Sandu accused the Kremlin of \"blackmail\" possibly aimed at destabilising her country before a general election in 2025. The Moldovan government also said it had offered aid to Transnistria. The EU has found alternative sources in liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar and the US, as well as piped gas from Norway, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In December, the European Commission laid out plans to entirely replace gas transiting through Ukraine. Russian gas has stopped passing through Ukraine after a five-year deal expired, leaving Moldova at risk of a crisis. Navy personnel from Devon and Cornwall were called on Christmas Day for a five-day operation. An earlier deal meant the EU kept responsibility for regulating medicines in NI but later said it was unworkable. The country is home to the biggest remaining contingent of French troops in the region. People in Moscow speak to BBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg about their wishes for the New Year.

        "title": "Police probe if blast at Trump hotel is linked to New Orleans attack ",
        "short_description": "Police in the US are investigating whether an explosion outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas is linked to the deadly car-ramming attack in New Orleans.",
        "long_description": "Police in the US are investigating whether an explosion outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas is linked to the deadly car-ramming attack in New Orleans. The driver of a Tesla Cybertruck was killed and seven other people were injured in Las Vegas after the vehicle - filled with fuel canisters and firework mortars - exploded. Officials said all injuries were minor. In the New Orleans attack, a 42-year-old US citizen is believed to have driven a pick-up truck into a crowd on a busy street, killing 14 people and injuring 35, before being shot dead by police. President Joe Biden said investigators were looking into whether the two incidents were linked, but \"thus far, there is nothing to report\". More on the New Orleans attack The Cybertruck was rented in Colorado and arrived in the city on Wednesday morning, less than two hours before the detonation, police said. Parked in front of the hotel near a glass entrance, the vehicle started to smoke, then exploded. The vehicle was rented to Matthew Alan Livelsberger, an active duty US Army service member. Officials are working to verify that he was the driver found dead in the truck. The driver also had a gunshot wound to the head, which police said was self-inflicted. Livelsberger had been serving in Germany but was on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident, CBS reported. Two relatives of Livelsberger confirmed to CBS he had rented the Cybertruck but were unaware of his involvement in the incident. One relative said Livelsberger's wife had not heard from him in several days. Sheriff Kevin McMahill showed reporters dramatic footage of the explosion and photos of the aftermath, including several fuel canisters along with large fireworks in the truck bed. Footage showed the truck parked directly in front of the entrance of the hotel. The truck sits idle for several seconds before exploding - bursts of multi-coloured fireworks shooting in multiple directions. Another video showed investigators using a black fire-retardant tarp to put out the blaze and the charred remains of the truck bed. An array of gas and fuel canisters were left behind along with the remnants of more than a dozen firework mortars. The fire occurred around 08:40 PT (15:40 GMT), just hours after a man drove a truck with an Islamic State (IS) group flag into the crowd in New Orleans. Officials said 15 people died in that attack, including the perpetrator, and at least 39 others were injured. Mr McMahill of the Las Vegas Police Department said the authorities were examining whether the incident could be connected to the one in New Orleans, where improvised explosive devices were found near the scene. He said they were also investigating whether it might be linked to President-Elect Donald Trump, who owns the hotel, or Elon Musk, who owns Tesla. \"Obviously, a Cybertruck, the Trump Hotel, there's lots of questions that we have to answer as we move forward,\" he said. The FBI also said the agency was looking into whether the incident might be an act of terrorism, but the authorities said they currently had not confirmed the identity of the driver, who died in the vehicle. Authorities also said thus far, they had found no evidence that this incident was related to IS. In an update on Thursday on the New Orleans attack, the FBI said that there is \"no definitive link\" at this point between the two incidents, but officers cautioned that it is still \"very early\" in the investigation. A Turo spokesperson said in a statement that the company was working with authorities in Las Vegas and New Orleans to help with the investigation. The spokesperson noted both renters appeared to not have a criminal background that would have \"identified them as a security threat\". \"We are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in New Orleans and Las Vegas, and our prayers are with the victims and families,\" the statement reads. Mr McMahill said there was no longer a threat to the Las Vegas community. The hotel is owned in part by President-elect Donald Trump's company. In a post on X, Trump's son, Eric Trump, said a \"reported electric vehicle fire occurred in the porte coch\u00e8re of Trump Las Vegas\". \"The safety and well-being of our guests and staff remain our top priority. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Las Vegas Fire Department and local law enforcement for their swift response and professionalism,\" he said. Stephen Ferlando told the Washington Post that he had witnessed the incident from his hotel room on the 53rd floor of the Trump Tower. He told the outlet there was \"definitely an explosion\" and that the windows had begun to shake. The Trump Hotel spans 64 floors with around 1,300 suites, according to its website. Trump recently named Musk to co-lead a presidential advisory commission, the Department of Government Efficiency, after the two became close during Trump's campaign. Police say that 18 people were injured in the deadly crash in the city of Fullerton, California. A whale that famously pushed its calf's dead body for 17 days in 2018 appears to be grieving again. People partake in a moment of silence to remember the victims of Wednesday's deadly attack. The family of one 25-year-old victim says they have had \"zero information\" about how he was killed.

        "title": "UK's biggest ever dinosaur footprint site unearthed",
        "short_description": "The UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site has been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire.",
        "long_description": "The UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site has been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire. About 200 huge footprints, which were made 166 million years ago, criss-cross the limestone floor. They reveal the comings and goings of two different types of dinosaurs that are thought to be a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and the smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus. The longest trackways are 150m in length, but they could extend much further as only part of the quarry has been excavated. \"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropalaeontologist from the University of Birmingham. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\" The tracks were first spotted by Gary Johnson, a worker at Dewars Farm Quarry, while he was driving a digger. \"I was basically clearing the clay, and I hit a hump, and I thought it's just an abnormality in the ground,\" he said, pointing to a ridge where some mud has been pushed up as a dinosaur's foot pressed down into the earth. \"But then it got to another, 3m along, and it was a hump again. And then it went another 3m - hump again.\" Another trackway site had been found nearby in the 1990s, so he realised the regular bumps and dips could be dinosaur footprints. \"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal - a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News. This summer, more than 100 scientists, students and volunteers joined an excavation at the quarry which features on the new series of Digging for Britain. The team found five different trackways. Four of them were made by sauropods, plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four legs. Their footprints look a bit like an elephant's - only much much bigger - these beasts reached up to 18m in length. Another track is thought to have been created by a Megalosaurus. \"It's almost like a caricature of a dinosaur footprint\", explained Dr Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. \"It's what we call a tridactyl print. It's got these three toes that are very, very clear in the print.\" The carnivorous creatures, which walked on two legs, were agile hunters, she said. \"The whole animal would have been 6-9m in length. They were the largest predatory dinosaurs that we know of in the Jurassic period in Britain.\" The environment they lived in was covered by a warm, shallow lagoon and the dinosaurs left their prints as they ambled across the mud. \"Something must have happened to preserve these in the fossil record,\" said Prof Richard Butler, a palaeobiologist from the University of Birmingham. \"We don't know exactly what, but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away.\" The team studied the trackways in detail during the dig. As well as making casts of the tracks, they took more than 20,000 photographs to create 3D models of both the complete site and individual footprints. \"The really lovely thing about a dinosaur footprint, particularly if you have a trackway, is that it is a snapshot in the life of the animal,\" Prof Butler explained. \"You can learn things about how that animal moved. You can learn exactly what the environment that it was living in was like. So tracks give us a whole different set of information that you can't get from the bone fossil record.\" One area of the site even reveals where the paths of a sauropod and megalosaurus once crossed. The prints are so beautifully preserved that the team have been able to work out which animal passed through first - they believe it was the sauropod, because the front edge of its large, round footprint is slightly squashed down by the three-toed megalosaurus walking on top of it. \"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" said Dr Duncan Murdock from Oxford University. \"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\" The future fate of the trackways hasn't yet been decided but the scientists are working with Smiths Bletchington, who operate the quarry, and Natural England on options for preserving the site for the future. They believe there could be more footprints, these echoes of our prehistoric past, just waiting to be discovered. The excavation is featured on Digging for Britain on BBC Two at 20:00 on Wednesday 8 January. The full series will be available on BBC iPlayer on 7 January. Researchers say new DNA research could shed new light on what history books say about ancient Britain. Astronomers are poised to see a star system about 3,000 light years away explode into brightness.

        "short_description": "Social media company TikTok faces a ban in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance by 19 January.",
        "long_description": "Social media company TikTok faces a ban in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance by 19 January. However, President-elect Donald Trump - who takes office the next day - has asked the Supreme Court to delay the ban when it hears arguments about the case on 10 January. US officials and lawmakers have accused TikTok's owner ByteDance of being linked to the Chinese government. Many have cited national security concerns over the app, claiming that it could be forced by Beijing to hand over data about its 170 million US users. The US Justice Department has said that because of its Chinese parent company, and access to data on American users, TikTok poses \"a national-security threat of immense depth and scale\". In April 2024, US Congress passed a bill, which President Joe Biden signed into law, giving ByteDance nine months to find a US-approved buyer or see TikTok shut down across the US. TikTok and ByteDance deny being linked to the Chinese government, or that any data would be handed over. They have also previously ruled out a sale. The firms have filed multiple legal challenges against the law, saying it is \"unconstitutional\" and would have a \"staggering\" impact on free speech by censoring its US users. They have said that even a temporary ban in early 2025 would have \"devastating effects\" on their operations and users. The US Supreme Court has deferred TikTok and ByteDance's request for an emergency injunction to delay a potential ban while it hears their case. It will hear arguments from the companies, and the US government, about whether the law violates the US constitutional right to free speech, on 10 January. Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election may offer TikTok a lifeline. He tried to ban the app while he was in the White House in 2020, but has now called on the US Supreme Court to delay the ban while he works on a \"political resolution\". Ahead of the hearing, his lawyer filed a legal brief saying that Trump \"opposes banning TikTok\" and intends to resolve the issues \"through political means once he takes office\". Trump's meeting with TikTok's boss Shou Zi Chew in December also increased hopes among the law's opponents that he would intervene. Online marketplaces, such as app stores, and web hosting platforms will have to stop making TikTok available to Americans if its ban goes ahead. Politicians have told Apple and Google's bosses to be ready to pull TikTok from the App Store and Google Play store for iOS and Android devices. Most people download apps onto their smartphones and tablets through app stores, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok. It also would mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs. The bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US. It gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties not only to China but also Russia, Iran and North Korea. At the heart of TikTok is its algorithm - a set of instructions that determine the content displayed to users, based on data about how they engaged with other material. TikTok can use this data, as well as information about an individual user's device, location and keystroke rhythms, to recommend videos to users on its automatically generated For You feed. Some researchers have previously claimed the app collects more data from users than others in order to power its highly personalised system. However, rival social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar user data. TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed there in June 2020. It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia. The UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission. The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears. Rival technology giant Huawei has also cut smartphone prices in the run-up to the Lunar New Year holiday. The BBC's Lily Jamali reports from outside the Trump International Hotel where the explosion took place. The ruling marks a significant moment in the long running battle over how to regulate internet providers.
