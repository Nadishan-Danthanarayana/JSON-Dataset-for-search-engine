        "long_description": "Three Chinese nationals have been arrested with 12 gold bars and $800,000 (\u00a3650,000) in cash in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, officials say. The gold and money was hidden under the seats of the vehicle they were travelling in, according to Jean Jacques Purusi, the governor of South Kivu province. He said the operation to arrest the men had been kept secret after the recent release of another group of Chinese nationals accused of running an illegal gold mine in the area. Eastern DR Congo has abundant reserves of gold, diamonds and the minerals used to make batteries for mobile phones and electric vehicles. This mineral wealth has been plundered by foreign groups since the colonial era and is one of the main reasons why the region has been plagued by instability for the last 30 years. Militia groups control many of the mines in eastern DR Congo and their leaders become wealthy by selling it to middle-men. Purusi said some of these dealers in precious metals enjoyed good relations with influential people in the capital, Kinshasa, and this was why the mission to carry out these latest arrests had to be kept quiet. He said they had been acting on a tip-off and that the gold and money was only found after a meticulous search of the vehicle in the Walungu area not far from the border with Rwanda. He did not say exactly how much gold had been seized. Last month, the governor told reporters he was shocked to hear that 17 Chinese nationals, who had been arrested on allegations they had been running an illegal gold mine, had been freed and allowed to return to China. He said this undermined efforts to clean up DR Congo's notoriously murky mineral sector. They owed $10m in taxes and fines to the government, the Reuters news agency quotes him as saying. The Chinese embassy has not commented on the allegations. The arrests come as fighting continues to flare in the neighbouring North Kivu province, where a Rwanda-backed rebel group has captured large areas of territory. Last month, DR Congo said it was suing Apple over the use of \"blood minerals\", prompting the tech giant to say it had stopped getting supplies from both DR Congo and neighbouring Rwanda. Rwanda has denied being a conduit for the export of illegal minerals from DR Congo. In their lawsuit, lawyers acting for the Congolese government alleged that the minerals taken from conflict areas was then \"laundered through international supply chains\". \"These activities have fuelled a cycle of violence and conflict by financing militias and terrorist groups and have contributed to forced child labour and environmental devastation,\" they said.

        "title": "Tanzania's fuel revolution slowed down by lack of filling stations",
        "short_description": "A revolution in vehicle fuel is gaining momentum in Tanzania, but a lack of filling stations means it is stuck in second gear.",
        "long_description": "A revolution in vehicle fuel is gaining momentum in Tanzania, but a lack of filling stations means it is stuck in second gear. Like Nigeria and some other countries on the continent, Tanzania is beginning to embrace compressed natural gas (CNG) as an alternative to petrol and diesel. It is seen as cleaner and better for the environment than those fossil fuels, but its relative cheapness is the biggest draw for the 5,000 or so motorists in the East African state who have embraced the change - particularly commercial drivers. This represents a small fraction of Tanzania's vehicles, but the early adopters are paving the way for a wider acceptance of CNG - the government reportedly wants near total adoption by the middle of the century. Tanzania has large reserves of gas under the sea and for those filling up, CNG can cost less than half its petrol equivalent. The potential saving was enough to persuade taxi owner Samuel Amos Irube to part with about 1.5m Tanzanian shillings ($620; \u00a3495) to convert his three-wheeled vehicle \u2013 known locally as a bajaji - to CNG. But now, having to get the gas twice a day, he often spends more time waiting at a filling station in the largest city, Dar es Salaam, than he does earning money. There are only four places in Tanzania's commercial hub where he can fill up. Quietly frustrated, he says he has to wait for at least three hours every time he wants to refuel, but the savings make it worth it, as he spends just 40% of what he would on the equivalent amount of petrol. The slow-moving queues of vehicles at the Ubungo CNG station snake down the road. Things are orderly \u2013 there are three clear lines, one for cars and two for bajajis \u2013 but the irritation is palpable. Medadi Kichungo Ngoma, in the queue for two hours already, stares at the vehicles ahead of him as he waits by his silver pick-up truck. He tells the BBC that he was among the first people in the city to convert his vehicle, which involved installing a large cylinder in the back of the pick-up, and reminisces about the short queues. \"Sometimes the attendant would have to be called to serve us,\" he says. He complains that the infrastructure has not expanded to accommodate the increasing demand. This is also the refrain heard at the largest of the city's CNG filling stations near the airport. Sadiki Christian Mkumbuka has waited here for three hours with his bajaji. \"The queue is very long,\" he says, adding that \"we should have as many stations as there are for petrol vehicles\". But the price consideration will keep people coming back. \"I pay 15,000 shillings ($6; \u00a35) to fill my 11kg gas tank, which goes for about 180km,\" says another motorist who introduces himself as Juma, adding that this is less than half the cost for petrol to cover the same distance. The push to encourage motorists to adopt CNG-powered vehicles in Tanzania was hatched over a decade ago but did not begin in earnest until 2018. Those in charge of the project acknowledge that they did not foresee the rapid rise in demand. Aristides Kato, the CNG project manager at the state-oil firm, the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), tells the BBC that there \"has been a very drastic increase\" recently in the use of natural gas by vehicle owners. \"We found ourselves not having enough infrastructure to support the demand for gas-using vehicles,\" he admits. The authorities, though, want more people to switch to CNG because it is a relatively clean-burning fossil fuel that results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants, according to the UN. Plus the locally available natural gas should allow for cheaper prices than petrol. But the cost of converting a vehicle plus the lower mileage that a full tank gives a motorist compared to petrol or diesel may be putting some people off. However, the country manager of Taqa Arabia, an Egyptian company that runs the filling station near the airport, sees the growing demand as a \"positive sign that CNG use has started to develop in Tanzania\". Amr Aboushady says his firm plans to build more stations and hopes to \"replicate our success story in Egypt by helping the [Tanzanian] government best utilise natural gas as an affordable, reliable, cleaner source of energy\". Egypt has pioneered the use of CNG on the continent, with about half a million vehicles converted to a dual-fuel system since the 1990s. Other African countries that have approved CNG use for vehicles include South Africa, Kenya, Mozambique and Ethiopia. The authorities in Tanzania are committed to rolling out more infrastructure and hope to encourage more private investors to get involved. A central CNG \"mother station\" is being built in Dar es Salaam by TPDC, which will supply gas to smaller stations around the country. In addition, TPDC is acquiring five mobile CNG units that will be located in Dar es Salaam as well as the capital, Dodoma, and Morogoro. These measures should in the medium-term lead to shorter queues, but for the time being the lack of filling stations will continue to frustrate Tanzania's CNG pioneers.

        "short_description": "The first congestion charge scheme for vehicles in the US has come into effect in New York City.",
        "long_description": "The first congestion charge scheme for vehicles in the US has come into effect in New York City. Car drivers will pay up to $9 (\u00a37) a day, with varying rates for other vehicles. The congestion zone covers an area south of central park, taking in well known sites such as the Empire State Building, Times Square and the financial district around Wall Street The scheme aims to ease New York's notorious traffic problems and raise billions for the public transport network, but has faced resistance, including from famous New Yorker and President-elect Donald Trump. New York state Governor Kathy Hochul made the case for a congestion charge two years ago, but it was delayed and revised following complaints from some commuters and businesses. The new plan revives one scheme that she paused in June, saying there were \"too many unintended consequences for New Yorkers\". Most drivers will be charged $9 once per day to enter the congestion zone at peak hours, and $2.25 at other times. Small trucks and non-commuter buses will pay $14.40 to enter Manhattan at peak times, while larger trucks and tourist buses will pay a $21.60 fee. The charge has been met with plenty of opposition, including from taxi drivers' associations. But its most high-profile opposition has come from Trump, a native New Yorker who has vowed to kill the scheme when he returns to office this month. Local Republicans have already asked him to intervene. Congressman Mike Lawler, who represents a suburban district just north of New York City, asked Trump in November to commit to \"ending this absurd congestion pricing cash grab once and for all\". A judge denied an 11th-hour effort Friday by neighbouring New Jersey state officials to block the scheme on grounds of its environmental impact on adjoining areas. Last year, New York City was named the world's most-congested urban area for the second year in a row, according to INRIX, a traffic-data analysis firm. Vehicles in downtown Manhattan drove at a speed of 11mph (17km/h) during peak morning periods in the first quarter of last year, the report said.

        "long_description": "Hamas has posted a video showing a 19-year-old Israeli captive, as indirect talks between the group and Israel on a ceasefire and hostage release deal resume in Qatar. The footage shows Liri Albag calling for the Israeli government to reach a deal. She was taken hostage along with six other female conscript soldiers at the Nahal Oz army base on the Gaza border during Hamas's October 2023 attack. Five of them remain in captivity. The announcement of renewed talks came as Israel intensified attacks on Gaza, with the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry saying on Sunday that 88 people had been killed in bombardment over the past 24 hours. One strike on a home in Gaza City on Saturday killed 11 people including seven children, according to the Gaza civil defence agency. Images showed residents searching through rubble for survivors and the bodies of the dead wrapped in shrouds. \"A huge explosion woke us up. Everything was shaking,\" neighbour Ahmed Mussa told AFP. \"It was home to children, women. There wasn't anyone wanted or who posed a threat.\" The Israeli military said on Sunday that it had struck more than 100 \"terror targets\" in the Gaza Strip over the past two days and \"eliminated dozens of Hamas terrorists\" Responding to the video showing their daughter, Liri Albag's parents said it had torn their hearts to pieces and they appealed to the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \"make decisions as if your own children were there\". The Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters, which represents hostage families, said the sign of life from Liri was \"harsh and undeniable proof of the urgency in bringing all the hostages home\". In a call to Lira Albag's parents, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said his country's delegation would remain at the negotiating table until all hostages were returned home. Israeli officials have previously described the release of such videos by Hamas as psychological warfare. Last month a senior Palestinian official told the BBC that talks to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal were mostly complete, but key issues still needed to be bridged. On Sunday the Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen, the latest in a series of such attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi movement. The Houthis said they had fired a \"hypersonic ballistic missile\" towards a power station near the Israeli city of Haifa. The group says it began targeting shipping in the Red Sea and firing projectiles at Israel in response to Israeli military actions in Gaza. The current war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage. Israel's military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed more than 45,800 people, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. On Saturday the Gaza health ministry said all three government hospitals in northern Gaza were completely out of service and \"destroyed\" by the Israeli military. The Israeli military has imposed a blockade on parts of northern Gaza since October, with the UN saying the area has been under \"near-total siege\" as Israeli forces heavily restrict access of aid deliveries to an area where an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people remain. Late last month the Israeli military forced patients and medical staff to leave Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia, alleging the facility was a \"Hamas terrorist stronghold\" and arresting the hospital director Hussam Abu Safiya. It said it had facilitated the transfer of some medical staff and patients to the Indonesian hospital nearby. But the Gaza health ministry said on Saturday that that hospital had also been taken out of service, along with the hospital in Beit Hanoun. World Health Organisation chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus again called for an end to attacks on hospitals and health professionals. \"People in Gaza need access to health care,\" he said. Israel says its forces operate in accordance with international law and do not target civilians. On Saturday the Biden administration said it was planning an $8bn (\u00a36.4bn) arms sale to Israel. The weapons consignment, which needs approval from US House and Senate committees, includes missiles, shells and other munitions. The move comes just over a fortnight before Biden leaves office and Donald Trump takes over as president. Washington has consistently rejected calls to suspend military backing for Israel because of the number of civilians killed in Gaza. What the conflict in 2024 means for 2025... Israel claimed responsibility for the strikes, saying it had targeted Houthi \"military infrastructure\". It also said that soldiers did not know the hostages were there when they began their operation. Four rioters are jailed after a Europa League match between Ajax and Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv.

        "long_description": "Sushi restaurateurs in Tokyo say they have paid 207m yen ($1.3m; \u00a31m) for a bluefin tuna which is about the size and weight of a motorbike. The sale is the second highest price ever paid at the annual new year auction at Toyosu Fish Market in the Japanese capital. Onodera Group, which had the winning bid, said the tuna - which weighs in at 276kg (608lb) - would be served at its Michelin-starred Ginza Onodera restaurants, as well as Nadaman restaurants across the country. \"The first tuna is something meant to bring in good fortune,\" Onodera official Shinji Nagao told reporters after the auction, news agency AFP reported. Mr Nagao added that he hoped people would eat the tuna - caught off the Aomori region in northern Japan - and \"have a wonderful year\". The group has paid the top price in the Ichiban Tuna auction for five years straight. Last year, it forked out 114m yen for the top tuna. The highest auction price since comparable records began in 1999 was 333.6m yen in 2019 for a 278kg bluefin. It was paid by self-styled Japanese \"Tuna King\" and sushi restaurant owner Kiyoshi Kimura. Toyosu fish market, which opened in 1935, claims to be the biggest fish market in the world, and is known for pre-dawn daily tuna auctions. But tuna was not the only catch on offer on Sunday, with Hokkaido sea urchins also fetching a record-breaking 7m yen according to the Japan Times. Ms Itooka lived through two world wars and was credited with a sprightly spirit all her life. Biden decided to scrap the deal despite concerns that it could damage Washington's relations with Tokyo.

        "long_description": "January 5, 2025 12:39 pm Tax expert N.R. Gajendran says Sri Lanka\u2019s inability to meet tax revenue targets despite tax hikes is due to the tax leakages spurred by tax evasion. Joining Ada Derana\u2019s current affairs program \u201c@HydePark\u201d, Gajendran further expressed that digitalization of proceedings of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) will significantly contribute to bolstering efficiency while also eradicating loopholes which facilitate tax evasion. \u201cAll the taxes have gone up, but we\u2019re still struggling to achieve 13.9% to 14% tax revenue. Next year, 2025, we\u2019re hoping to reach 15%, which is still below what we achieved in the early 90s, 22% tax to GDP ratio. Most of the countries, even developing countries achieve 18% - 22% taxes\u201d, Gajendran mentioned. \u201cIf you want to have macroeconomic stability, when we consider a developed country, tax to GDP ratio should be about 28% - 30%. Now we still have this gap. We\u2019re collecting so much from people and we\u2019re still falling short. Next year, at our best, we\u2019ll reach 15%. We had 22% before, in 2022. Where is this 5% - 7% gap? I\u2019m telling, that is the evasion and fraud and corruption\u201d, he added. \u201cThis money is not with the small taxpayers. It is with the big taxpayers. Reforms cannot take place when it is corrupt. If higher-ups are corrupt, all subordinates will be corrupt, as the former President said,\u201d Gajendran emphasized. Meanwhile, Tax Consultant, Attorney-at-Law Suresh Perera revealed that tax evasion is most often committed by top tax payers and not those in the lower tax brackets, although they have been at the centre of attention when drafting tax legislation. Commenting regarding the matter, Perera emphasized the tax leakage exists due to improper enforcement of laws, reiterating that the tax leakage takes place due to evasion by top tax payers. \u201cThe law is there, but it\u2019s not been followed. What is happening in here is that now the focus is on small man,\u201d perera added. Furthermore, he emphasized that policymakers focus on individual tax payers, stressing that the policies should be made focusing on large corporations, from which a huge tax revenue is being collected.

        "long_description": "January 4, 2025 09:34 pm Russia has vowed retaliation after claiming to have shot down eight US-made ATACMS missiles fired by Ukraine on Saturday morning. Moscow sees the use of such missiles, which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles), as a major escalation. The country\u2019s air defenses shot down the eight ballistic missiles alongside 72 aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense said. It added that \u201cthese actions by the Kyiv regime, which is supported by Western curators, will be met with retaliation.\u201d The statement said several drones were destroyed in the Leningrad region in the north-west and one in Kursk, where Ukraine launched a surprise attack late last summer. The outgoing US President Joe Biden approved Kyiv\u2019s use of ATACMS in November \u2013 saying in part it was in response to Russia expanding the conflict by deploying North Korean troops. Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to respond to Ukrainian strikes using ATACMS with Russia\u2019s new nuclear-capable ballistic missile \u201cOreshnik.\u201d Last month, Putin suggested that it could be fired at the capital Kyiv as a test of Western-supplied air defense systems. The first and only launch of the experimental weapon targeted Ukraine\u2019s Dnipro region on the morning of November 21. The Ukrainian drone attacks forced temporary restrictions to be introduced at an airport in St. Petersburg, Russian state media agency TASS reported. The governor of Leningrad oblast, Aleksandr Drozdenko, said in a statement on Telegram that the \u201cnight and morning of January 4 were record-breaking in terms of the number of UAVs destroyed,\u201d with four shot down over his region. A Ukrainian security official, Andrii Kovalenko, said a seaport in Leningrad was targeted, calling it an \u201cinstrument of economic and military survival for Russia in isolation.\u201d Meanwhile, Russia launched a total of 81 drones at Ukraine overnight on Friday into Saturday, according to Ukraine\u2019s Air Force Command, including Iranian-made Shahed drones and \u201cvarious types of imitation drones.\u201d Some 34 Shahed attack UAVs and other types of drones were downed, according to a statement, although the downed drones caused damage in the Chernihiv and Sumy regions. Ukraine enters the year on the back foot in the conflict, which began with in February 2022, with Russian making gains on the eastern frontlines. Russia\u2019s defense ministry said on Saturday that its forces had taken control of the village of Nadiya in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Luhansk region. In Donetsk, the hub of Pokrovsk is under growing Russian pressure as Ukrainian forces lose ground to the south and east of the town. Ukraine is also concerned that the incoming Trump administration could cut vital military aid; Trump himself has vowed to end the conflict. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "long_description": "January 5, 2025 07:16 pm The Office of the Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, has categorically denied any involvement in the cancellation of the scheduled lecture organized by the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) at Peradeniya University. Issuing a statement, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said that Dr. Amarasuriya has consistently championed academic freedom and democratic engagement, values fundamental to fostering critical discourse in educational institutions. The allegations suggesting that the Prime Minister and Minister of Education influenced the university\u2019s decision to cancel the lecture are entirely baseless and misleading, the statement highlighted. Furthermore, the Office of the Prime Minister and Minister of Education has assured that no directive or instruction was issued from this office regarding the event, noting that the autonomy of academic institutions is a principle that the government is committed to upholding. \u201cUniversities must remain places where diverse opinions, including critiques of government policies, can be freely expressed and discussed without fear of suppression. Nevertheless, we express concern about any action that undermines democratic expression and open dialogue within academic spaces\u201d, it added. The statement also added that Dr. Amarasuriya reaffirms her unwavering commitment to protecting the rights of students and educators to engage in meaningful and critical discourse, mentioning that upholding these principles is vital to maintaining the trust and confidence of the university community and the public at large.",

        "title": "Biden plans to send $8bn arms shipment to Israel",
        "short_description": "January 5, 2025 10:47 am",
        "long_description": "January 5, 2025 10:47 am The US Department of State has notified Congress of a planned $8bn (\u00a36.4bn) arms sale to Israel, an American official has confirmed to the BBC. The weapons consignment, which needs approval from House and Senate committees, includes missiles, shells and other munitions. The move comes just over a fortnight before President Joe Biden leaves office. Washington has rejected calls to suspend military backing for Israel because of the number of civilians killed during the war in Gaza. In August, the US approved the sale of $20bn in fighter jets and other military equipment to Israel. The latest planned shipment contains air-to-air missiles, Hellfire missiles, artillery shells and bombs, the US official said. A source familiar with the sale told the BBC on Saturday: \u201cThe president has made clear Israel has a right to defend its citizens, consistent with international law and international humanitarian law, and to deter aggression from Iran and its proxy organisations. \u201cWe will continue to provide the capabilities necessary for Israel\u2019s defence.\u201d Biden has often described US support for Israel as iron-clad. The US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, having helped it build one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the US accounted for 69% of Israel\u2019s imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023. In May 2024, the US confirmed it had paused a single consignment of 2,000lb and 500lb bombs over concerns Israel was going ahead with a major ground operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. But Biden immediately faced a backlash from Republicans in Washington and from Netanyahu who appeared to compare it to an \u201carms embargo\u201d. Biden has since partially lifted the suspension and not repeated it. The planned shipment is one of a number of steps taken by the Biden administration in recent weeks, as the outgoing president attempts to shore up his legacy. It will likely also be the last planned weapons sale to Israel before he leaves the White House on 20 January 2025, when his successor Donald Trump is inaugurated. The president-elect has previously spoken of ending foreign conflicts, and of reducing US involvement, including during his re-election bid. Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel, but has urged the American ally to finish its military operation in Gaza quickly. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group\u2019s unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 45,580 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The first operation targets vehicles with various horns, additional flashing lights of different colors, illegal modifications, loud horns, loud silencers, and additional parts that could contribute to accidents and road hazards. The second operation will involve deploying police officers dressed in civil clothing to identify traffic violations committed by drivers of public transport buses and enforce law for those violations, according to police. These operations were implemented as a two-week pilot project from yesterday (January 4) until January 19, with the objective of raising awareness among motorists and the public. Accordingly, the police have stated that, in connection with the first operation, drivers will be warned and informed, and instructed to remove any unauthorized parts or modifications installed in their vehicles during that time. It has also been announced that this system is expected to continue, with further steps to enforce the law against unauthorized vehicle modifications, and police officers dressed in civil clothing will also be deployed on public transport buses to gather information. Accordingly, Sri Lanka Police announced that a grace period until January 19 has been given for vehicle owners to remove illegal modifications, including additional horns and lights.",

        "short_description": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has gone on trial in Paris, accused of taking millions of euros of illicit funds from the late Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi to finance his 2007 election campaign.",
        "long_description": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has gone on trial in Paris, accused of taking millions of euros of illicit funds from the late Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi to finance his 2007 election campaign. In exchange, the prosecution alleges Sarkozy promised to help Gaddafi combat his reputation as a pariah with Western countries. Sarkozy, 69, was the president of France from 2007 to 2012. He has always denied the charges, saying they were brought against him by people with motivations to bring him down. The investigation was opened in 2013, two years after Saif al-Islam, son of the then-Libyan leader, first accused Sarkozy of taking millions of his father's money for campaign funding. The following year, Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine - who for a long time acted as a middleman between France and the Middle East - said he had written proof that Sarkozy's campaign bid was \"abundantly\" financed by Tripoli, and that the \u20ac50m (\u00a343m) worth of payments continued after he became president. Twelve other people - accused of devising the pact with Gaddafi - are standing trial along Sarkozy. They all deny the charges. Sarkozy's wife, Italian-born former supermodel and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was charged last year with hiding evidence linked to the Gaddafi case and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud, both of which she denies. Since losing his re-election bid in 2012, Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations. He also appealed against a February 2024 ruling which found him guilty of overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign, then hiring a PR firm to cover it up. He was handed a one-year sentence, of which six months were suspended. In 2021, he was found guilty of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 and became the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. In December, the Paris appeals court ruled that he could serve his time at home wearing a tag instead of going to jail. Sarkozy was not wearing the tag as he arrived in court in Paris on Monday morning. However, that is only because the details of that sentence have yet to be worked out. It is likely that in the course of this three-month trial over the so-called Libya connection, the former president will appear wearing the device. The trial is set to continue until 10 April. If found guilty, Sarkozy faces up to 10 years in prison. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

        "long_description": "A former HMP Wandsworth prison officer who was filmed having sex with an inmate has been jailed for 15 months. Linda De Sousa Abreu was identified by senior prison staff after the clip was shared online and quickly went viral. The governor of Wandsworth said Abreu's actions had taken \"less than a day\" to undo the many years of work on behalf of female staff in all-male prisons. Abreu, 30, who was arrested at Heathrow Airport before attempting to board a flight to Madrid with her father, previously pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office. In a partial written statement to Isleworth Crown Court, Andrew Davy, the governor of Wandsworth, said many female staff at the prison had reported an increase in being \"hit on\" by inmates and were now \"considered fair game\". Abreu and the inmate were filmed in a cell between 26 and 28 June. The Metropolitan Police said inquiries were ongoing into the two prisoners identified in the video. The court was also told that a further recording of her performing a sex act with the same inmate was found on her prison-issue body-worn camera - and Abreu had admitted to having sex with that prisoner on an additional occasion. Judge Martin Edmunds KC said the video that went viral was therefore not isolated and was part of repeated behaviour. A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: \"While the overwhelming majority of Prison Service staff are hardworking and honest, we're catching more of the small minority who break the rules by bolstering our Counter Corruption Unit and strengthening our vetting processes. \"As today's sentencing demonstrates, where officers do fall below our high standards we won't hesitate to take robust action.\" The Prison Officers' Association, which represents prison staff, said it acknowledged there were a small number of corrupt staff working in prisons who undermined the work of others.

        "short_description": "More Vietnamese attempted small-boat Channel crossings in the first half of 2024 than any other nationality. Yet they are coming from one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Why, then, are so many risking their lives to reach Britain?",
        "long_description": "More Vietnamese attempted small-boat Channel crossings in the first half of 2024 than any other nationality. Yet they are coming from one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Why, then, are so many risking their lives to reach Britain? Phuong looked at the small inflatable boat and wondered whether she should step in. There were 70 people packed in, and it was sitting low in the water. She recalls the fear, exhaustion and desperation on their faces. There weren't enough lifejackets to go around. But Phuong was desperate. She says she had been stuck in France for two months, after travelling there from Vietnam via Hungary, sleeping in tents in a scrubby forest. Already she had refused to travel on one boat because it seemed dangerously overcrowded, and previously had been turned back in the middle of the Channel three times by bad weather or engine failure. Her sister, Hien, lives in London, and recalls that Phuong used to phone her from France in tears. \"She was torn between fear and a drive to keep going. \"But she had borrowed so much - around \u00a325,000 - to fund this trip. Turning back wasn't an option.\" So, she climbed on board. Today Phuong lives in London with her sister, without any legal status. She was too nervous to speak to us directly, and Phuong is not her real name. She left it to her sister, who is now a UK citizen, to describe her experiences. In the six months to June, Vietnamese made up the largest number of recorded small boat arrivals with 2,248 landing in the UK, ahead of people from countries with well-documented human rights problems, including Afghanistan and Iran. The extraordinary efforts made by Vietnamese migrants to get to Britain is well documented, and in 2024 the BBC reported on how Vietnamese syndicates are running successful people-smuggling operations. It is not without significant risks. Some Vietnamese migrants end up being trafficked into sex work or illegal marijuana farms. They make up more than one-tenth of those in the UK filing official claims that they are victims of modern slavery. And yet Vietnam is a fast-growing economy, acclaimed as a \"mini-China\" for its manufacturing prowess. Per capita income is eight times higher than it was 20 years ago. Add to that the tropical beaches, scenery and affordability, which have made it a magnet for tourists. So what is it that makes so many people desperate to leave? Vietnam, a one-party Communist state, sits near the bottom of most human rights and freedom indexes. No political opposition is permitted. The few dissidents who raise their voices are harassed and jailed. Yet most Vietnamese have learned to live with the ruling party, which leans for legitimacy on its record of delivering growth. Very few who go to Britain are fleeing repression. Nor are the migrants generally fleeing poverty. The World Bank has singled Vietnam out for its almost unrivalled record of poverty reduction among its 100 million people. Rather, they are trying to escape what some call \"relative deprivation\". Despite its impressive economic record, Vietnam started far behind most of its Asian neighbours, with growth only taking off well after the end of the Cold War in 1989. As a result, average wages, at around \u00a3230 a month, are much lower than in nearby countries like Thailand, and three-quarters of the 55-million-strong workforce are in informal jobs, with no security or social protection. \"There is a huge disparity between big cities like Hanoi and rural areas,\" says Nguyen Khac Giang, a Vietnamese academic at the Institute of South East Asian Studies-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"For a majority of workers with limited skills, there is a glass ceiling. Even if you work 14 hours a day you cannot save enough to build a house or start a family.\" This was what Phuong felt, despite coming from Haiphong, Vietnam's third-largest city. Her sister Hien had made it to Britain nine years earlier, smuggled inside a shipping container. It had cost her around \u00a322,000 but she was able to pay that back in two years, working long hours in kitchens and nail salons. Hien married a Vietnamese man who already had British citizenship, and they had a daughter; all three are now UK citizens. In Haiphong, jobs were scarce after the pandemic and at 38 years old, Phuong wanted what her sister had in London: the ability to save money and start a family. \"She could survive in Vietnam, but she wanted a home, a better life, with more security,\" explains Hien. Lan Anh Hoang, a professor in development studies at Melbourne University, has spent years studying migration patterns. \"Twenty to thirty years ago, the urge to migrate overseas was not as strong, because everyone was poor,\" she says. \"People were happy with one buffalo, one motorbike and three meals a day. \"Suddenly a few people successfully migrated to countries like Germany or the UK, to work on cannabis farms or open nail salons. They started to send a lot of money home. Even though the economic conditions of those left behind have not changed, they feel poor relative to all these families with migrants working in Europe.\" This tradition of seeking better lives overseas goes back to the 1970s and 80s, when Vietnam was allied to the Soviet Union following the defeat of US forces in the south. The state-led economy had hit rock bottom. Millions were destitute; some areas suffered food shortages. Tens of thousands left to work in eastern bloc countries like Poland, East Germany and Hungary. This was also a time when 800,000 mainly ethnic Chinese boat people fled the communist party's repressive actions, making perilous sea journeys across the South China Sea, eventually resettling in the USA, Australia or Europe. The economic hardships of that time threatened the legitimacy of the communist party, and in 1986 it made an abrupt turn, abandoning the attempt to build a socialist system and throwing the doors open to global markets. The new theme of Vietnam's national story was to catch up, and get rich, any way possible. For many Vietnamese, that meant going abroad. \"Money is God in Vietnam,\" says Lan An Hoang. \"The meaning of 'the good life' is primarily anchored in your ability to accumulate wealth. There is also a strong obligation to help your family, especially in central Vietnam. \"That is why the whole extended family pools resources to finance the migration of one young person because they believe they can send back large sums of money, and facilitate the migration of other people.\" Drive through the flat rice fields of Nghe An, one of Vietnam's poorer provinces lying south of Hanoi, and where there were once smaller concrete houses, you will now find large, new houses with gilded gates. More are under construction, thanks, in part, to money earned in the West. The new houses are prominent symbols of success for returnees who have done well overseas. Vietnam is now enjoying substantial inflows of foreign investment, as it is considered an alternative to China for companies wanting to diversify their supply chains. This investment is even beginning to reach places like Nghe An, too. Foxconn, a corporate giant that manufactures iPhones, is one of several foreign businesses building factories in Nghe An, offering thousands of new jobs. But monthly salaries for unskilled workers only reach around \u00a3300, even with overtime. That is not enough to rival the enticing stories of the money to be made in the UK, as told by the people smugglers. The business of organising the travel for those wishing to leave the province is now a very profitable one. Publicly, companies present themselves as either travel agents or brokers for officially approved overseas labour contracts, but in practice many also offer to smuggle people to the UK via other European countries. They usually paint a rosy picture of life in Britain, and say little about the risks and hardships they will face. \"Brokers\" typically charge between \u00a315,000 and \u00a335,000 for the trip to the UK. Hungary is a popular route into the EU because it offers guest-worker visas to Vietnamese passport holders. The higher the price, the easier and faster the journey. The communist authorities in Vietnam have been urged by the US, the UK and UN agencies to do more to control the smuggling business. Remittances from abroad earn Vietnam around \u00a313bn a year, and the government has a policy of promoting migration for work, although only through legal channels, mostly to richer Asian countries. More than 130,000 Vietnamese workers left in 2024 under the official scheme. But the fees for these contracts can be high, and the wages are much lower than they can earn in Britain. The huge risks of the illicit routes used to reach the UK were brought home in 2019, when 39 Vietnamese people were found dead in Essex, having suffocated while being transported inside a sealed container across the Channel. Yet this has not noticeably reduced demand for the smugglers' services. The increased scrutiny of container traffic has, however, pushed them to find alternative Channel crossings, which helps explain the sharp rise in Vietnamese people using small boats. \"The tragedy of the 39 deaths in 2019 is almost forgotten,\" says the cousin of one of the victims, Le Van Ha. He left behind a wife, two young children and a large debt from the cost of the journey. His cousin, who does not want to be named, says attitudes in their community have not changed. \"People hardly care anymore. It's a sad reality, but it is the truth. \"I see the trend of leaving continuing to grow, not diminish. For people here, the success stories still outweigh the risks.\" Three of the victims came from the agricultural province of Quang Binh. The headteacher of a secondary school in the region, who also asked not to be named, says that 80% of his students who graduate soon plan to go overseas. \"Most parents here come from low-income backgrounds,\" he explains. \"The idea of [encouraging their child to] broaden their knowledge and develop their skills is not the priority. \"For them, sending a child abroad is largely about earning money quickly, and getting it sent back home to improve the family's living standards.\" In March the UK Home Office started a social media campaign to deter Vietnamese people from illegal migration. Some efforts were also made by the Vietnamese government to alert people to the risks of using people-smugglers. But until there are more appealing economic opportunities in those provinces, it is likely the campaigns will have little impact. \"They cannot run these campaigns just once,\" argues Diep Vuong, co-founder of Pacific Links, an anti-trafficking organisation. \"It's a constant investment in education that's needed.\" She has first-hand experience, leaving Vietnam to the US in 1980 as part of the exodus of Vietnamese boat people. \"In Vietnam, people believe they have to work hard, to do everything for their families. That is like a shackle which they cannot easily escape. But with enough good information put out over the years, they might start to change this attitude.\" But the campaigns are up against a powerful narrative. Those who go overseas and fail \u2013 and many do \u2013 are often ashamed, and keep quiet about what went wrong. Those who succeed come back to places like Nghe An and flaunt their new-found wealth. As for the tragedy of the 39 people who died in a shipping container, the prevailing view in Nghe An is still that they were just unlucky.

        "long_description": "The list is released as new Israeli air strikes kill dozens in Gaza over the weekend. Two women and a police officer are killed after gunmen open fire on a bus and other vehicles in al-Funduq. The weapons consignment, which needs approval from House and Senate committees, includes air-to-air missiles. Marcus Fakana, 18, was jailed for having sex with a British girl, 17, while they were both on holiday. Time is running out for Nimisha Priya, who was convicted for the murder of a Yemeni man in 2017. Two women and a police officer are killed after gunmen open fire on a bus and other vehicles in al-Funduq. The new authorities have promised justice for crimes under the Assads, but there are huge challenges involved. It comes as Israel intensified strikes on Gaza, killing 88 people over the past 24 hours, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The weapons consignment, which needs approval from House and Senate committees, includes air-to-air missiles. The IDF had earlier told a local NGO it was unaware of his case, sparking concern. The officer was killed in an overnight air strike on a displaced people\u2019s camp in the southern Gaza. The Foreign Press Association has said the move \"raises serious questions about press freedom\". The UN rights office says the attacks raise serious concerns about war crimes and crimes against humanity. What the conflict in 2024 means for 2025... An estimated 17,000 children are unaccompanied or separated from family who would ordinarily care for them. Syrians across the world are still coming to terms with the rapid fall of the Assad regime.

The curriculum will take on a more Islamic slant, with evolution and Big Bang theory dropped from science. The Foreign Press Association has said the move \"raises serious questions about press freedom\". The move will raise concerns over the role radicalised foreign militants may play in Syria's future. Egypt's environment ministry says the attack occurred in \"deep waters outside of the designated swimming area\". Sharaa says it could take three years to write a constitution and longer to establish voting integrity.

        "short_description": "A huge winter storm has brought snow, ice and and freezing temperatures to a broad swathe of the US, with more than 60 million Americans under weather alerts.",
        "long_description": "A huge winter storm has brought snow, ice and and freezing temperatures to a broad swathe of the US, with more than 60 million Americans under weather alerts. Much of the US is waking up to below freezing temperatures on Monday morning, with some of the coldest conditions expected in Kansas, while the Washington DC area is awaiting unusually heavy snowfall. Forecasters say the extreme weather - named Storm Blair - is being caused by the polar vortex, an area of cold air that circulates around the Arctic. As of early Monday morning, 1,400 US flights had been cancelled for the day and 800 delayed, according to FlightAware.com. A state of emergency has been declared in of Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, Arkansas and parts of New Jersey. And much of Canada is also under weather alerts, as the blizzard conditions have dumped about a foot of snow (30cm) in places. Thirty US states, spanning from the middle of the country to the east coast - including major cities such as Washington DC and Philadelphia - are under weather alerts, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. On Sunday - which was forecast to be the most intense day of the storm - people in affected states saw roads cut off. Schools were shut down on Monday in Virginia, Maryland, Indiana and Kentucky. Hundreds of car accidents and stranded drivers were reported over the weekend in several midwestern states - including Kansas as well as Indiana, Kentucky and Virginia. Blizzard warnings have been issued in Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska. Kansas City is seeing its heaviest snow in 32 years, with more than a foot (30 to 40cm) having come down so far, according to Matthew Cappucci, a senior meteorologist at the weather app MyRadar. Parts of northern Missouri have already experienced 14in (36cm) of sleet and snow. The storm began moving toward the US's east coast on Sunday, with parts of Virginia, Maryland, Washington DC and Delaware due to take the brunt. Washington DC is bracing for heavy snow and bitter cold on Monday, the same day the US Congress is set to meet and formally certify Republican Donald Trump's election as president. But Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the weather would not prevent lawmakers from carrying out their duties. But officials have announced that federal offices in the nation's capital will be closed. The NWS said the winter storm could bring \"the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade\", while AccuWeather forecaster Dan DePodwin said: \"This could lead to the coldest January for the US since 2011.\" He added that \"temperatures that are well below historical average\" could linger for a week. Temperatures 12-25F (7-14C) below normal are forecast. Further north, Canadians are also feeling the effects of the polar vortex. Much of Canada has been under extreme weather alerts, with freezing temperatures spanning the country. Some areas are also seeing snow squalls - a sudden heavy snowfall accompanied by strong winds. In the central province of Manitoba, the wind chill could see temperatures plummet to as low as -40C. Meanwhile, as much as 15in (38cm) of snow was expected in parts of Ontario on Sunday. Amtrak has also cancelled numerous rail services. American, Delta, Southwest and United airlines are waiving change fees for passengers because of the potential flight disruptions. Conditions on roads have deteriorated, with crashes involving lorries and cars, as well as a fire engine rolling over near Salina, Kansas. \"Whiteout conditions will make travel extremely hazardous, with impassable roads and a high risk of motorists becoming stranded,\" the NWS warned. Meanwhile, severe thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes were set to move east from Arkansas and Louisiana into Mississippi and Alabama on Sunday evening, the NWS said. Private meteorologist Ryan Maue said: \"It's going to be a mess, a potential disaster. This is something we haven't seen in quite a while.\" How have you been affected by the storm?

Trump's lawyers said they would appeal the decision as sentencing in his New York criminal case looms Harris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.

        "short_description": "Five young Kenyan men - including a popular cartoonist - who went missing just before the Christmas holidays have been found alive, family members and rights groups say.",
        "long_description": "Five young Kenyan men - including a popular cartoonist - who went missing just before the Christmas holidays have been found alive, family members and rights groups say. Kenya has been gripped by a wave of disappearances, with the state-funded rights group saying that over 80 people have been abducted in the last six months. The abductions generally target government critics and are widely believed to be the work of security agents, although the authorities have not admitted responsibility. They began in June last year during nationwide anti-tax protests, but increased in December, when AI-generated photos of the president in a coffin were widely shared. The youth-led protests forced President William Ruto to withdraw a series of planned tax rises and shook his government, leaving his authority badly undermined. Kibet Bull, known for his silhouette cartoon memes critical of the president, announced his release on Monday afternoon on X to much fanfare. He told his 105,000 followers that he had been dropped off in the town of Luanda, nearly 370 km (229 miles) from the capital, Nairobi, where he was last seen in December. Kibet Bull said straight after he was released he went to a disco. His mother told the BBC she \"rejoiced\" after she heard the news that her son had returned. \"I gave him a call and we talked, we didn't talk much, the moment he told me 'I am Kibet' and I heard his voice, I screamed, I celebrated until he hung up,\" she said. The others released on Monday include 24-year-old student Billy Mwangi in Embu, in the central Mount Kenya region. Local MP Gitonga Mukunji told journalists that Mr Mwangi \"was whipped and beaten while in a dark room. He is traumatised.\" Mr Mwangi's father said his son was not able to discuss what he had gone through adding that he had been taken to hospital. \"He came home around eight in the morning. He walked by himself - his mother and I saw him. We thank everyone who has prayed and supported him,\" he told the Daily Nation news site. Last week, Mr Mwangi's father broke down in court as he pleaded for his son to be released. A relative of 22-year-old Peter Muteti, who was seized in Nairobi, on 21 December, told the BBC on Monday that he had been reunited with the family but was disoriented and unable to speak about the ordeal. Amnesty International Kenya welcomed the releases and urged \"the State to free all abductees and hold those responsible accountable\". Two weeks ago the police denied responsibility for the abductions carried out by men in plain clothes across the country, some of which were captured on CCTV. Rights groups and other Kenyans have linked the abductions to a shadowy intelligence and counter-terrorism unit of the security forces. Amid the public uproar, President Ruto said last month: \"We are going to stop the abductions so that our youth can live peacefully and have discipline\", while urging parents to take care of their children. Until now, no-one had been freed since he spoke on 27 December, with activists planning protests on Monday to push the government to act. On Monday the police released an update acknowledging the freeing of the men, saying they were already in contact with one of the abductees, Bernard Kavuli, who had presented himself at a police station. The police said investigations into all cases of missing people were under way. One other man - Ronny Kiplangat \u2013 has also been released, his family told local media. Mr Kavuli, a content creator, was seized on the outskirts of Nairobi in December, while Mr Kiplangat is the brother of Kibet Bull. Two others were seized after posting AI-generated images of the president. At least 24 people are still missing. The Law Society of Kenya has filed a legal case against the state, demanding the immediate and unconditional release of seven individuals abducted last month, including those who have now been released. The situation continues to stoke fear across the country, with parents worried about the safety of their children and activists vowing to maintain pressure until all missing persons are accounted for.

        "long_description": "The Arctic recently made headlines after Donald Trump repeated his desire to buy Greenland. Trump cited national security interests, but for many the territory's vast mineral wealth is the main attraction. Yet economic development elsewhere in the vast polar region has ground to a halt. Working conditions in the Arctic Ocean are extremely challenging at this time of the year for Norwegian fisherman Sondre Alnes-Bonesmo. The sun last rose at the end of October, and it is not due to appear in the sky again until the middle of February. In addition to the endless dark, temperatures can plummet below minus 40C, and storms can bring vast waves. Mr Alnes-Bonesmo, 30, works two six-hour shifts a day, during five-week tours on a ship called Granit. One of the largest factory trawlers fishing in Arctic waters north of Norway, and off the coast of Greenland, it doesn't stop for winter. Unsurprisingly, he prefers the endless daylight of summer. \"I do like it when the weather is nice, as we're not sent crashing into the walls and such, the way we are during storms, when the waves can be fairly big,\" he grins in understatement. Mr Alnes-Bonesmo is a participant in the so-called Arctic \"cold rush\". A play on words with gold rush, it began in earnest around 2008 when a series of reports identified vast mineral and hydrocarbon reserves across the Arctic region. Reserves that, together with large fishing stocks, could continue to become more accessible as climate change reduces ice levels. This reduction in ice has also increasingly opened up Arctic sea routes, north of the Canadian mainland and Russia. So much so that, in the decade from 2013 to 2023, the total recorded annual distances sailed by ships in the Arctic Sea more than doubled from 6.1 million to 12.9 million miles. The hope in the longer term is that cargo ships can travel from Asia to Europe and the east coast of the US, through Arctic waters above Canada and Russia. But the question Mr Alnes-Bonesmo now asks himself is this \u2013 did he arrive too late? Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 much of the planned economic development of the Arctic region ground to a halt as relations between Russia and the West deteriorated. \"Russia had great plans in the Arctic,\" says Morten Mejlaender-Larsen, Arctic operation and technology director from Norwegian firm DNV. His company sets rules and standards for the maritime sector. \"They began constructing regional rescue centres complete with ships and helicopters to facilitate both destination shipping for gas, oil and coal projects in Siberia, as well as for shipping along the Northeast Passage [north of Russia]. \"[But] since the invasion of Ukraine, international shipping in the Northeast passage has all but stopped, apart from a few Chinese ships,\" observes Mr Mejlaender-Larsen. He adds that Norway has also halted oil and gas exploration in the region. \"It's completely stopped,\" he says. \"We don't expect to see any further developments in the Barents Sea north of Bear Island.\" This small Norwegian island is some 400km (250 miles) north of Norway's mainland. Norway's scaled back ambitions in the Arctic have pleased environmentalists who have consistently warned about the impact of drilling for hydrocarbons on both wildlife and the fragile environment of the polar region. Last month Greenpeace welcomed the decision of the Norwegian government to stop the first round of licensing for deep sea mining in Arctic waters between Norway's Svalbard and Jan Mayen islands. Commentators say that while poor relations with Russia is a key reason why Norway is wary of ploughing money into Arctic projects, its interest in the polar region had already cooled. Helene Tofte, director of international cooperation and climate at the Norwegian Shipowners Association, says that in hindsight the outlook for shipping in the Arctic had been \"exaggerated\". She points out that despite the impact of climate change, the Arctic remains a difficult place in which to operate. \"Conditions in the Arctic can be extremely challenging, even when the absence of sea ice allows passage,\" she says. \"Large parts of the route are far from emergency response capacities, such as search and rescue, and environmental clean-up resources. \"Increased shipping in this area would require substantial investments in ships, emergency preparedness, infrastructure, and weather forecasting systems, for a route that is unpredictable and has a short operational season. At present, we have no indication that our members view this as commercially interesting.\" Mr Mejlaender-Larsen points to a \"belief that thanks to global warming there'll be summers up there. That'll never happen. If it's minus 40C and it gets 3C warmer, it's still not warm.\" Moreover, Prof Arild Moe, from Norwegian research group Fridtjof Nansen Institute, says the entire cold rush of the Arctic was based on exaggerated assumptions. \"The exuberance was excessive,\" says the expert on oil and gas exploration in the region. \"What the reports from 2008 referred to weren't actual reserves, but potential and highly uncertain resources, which would be risky, expensive, and difficult to locate and exploit.\" Regarding Trump's renewed interest in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, authorities in Greenland and Denmark were again quick to reply that it was not for sale. Prof Moe says that Trump's \"crude and undiplomatic statement\" shows that the US under Trump eyes both security and economic interests in the island, including its \"rich mineral resources\". The Danish government also responded by announcing a huge increase in defence spending for Greenland. Elsewhere in the Arctic, Trump is expected to allow increased oil and gas exploration in Alaska, specifically in the resource rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This 19 million acre expanse is the US's largest wildlife refuge, and back in 2020 Trump authorised drilling in one section of it. Meanwhile, Canada is continuing to build a deep-water port at Grays Bay, on the north coast of Nunavut, its most northern territory. Grays Bay is approximately in the centre of the so-called Northwest Passage, the Arctic sea route north of the Canadian mainland. Back on the Granit fishing ship, Mr Alnes-Bonesmo says that, while he has earned good money, fishing quotas continue to go down to try to preserve stocks in Norwegian Arctic waters. Nevertheless, he is philosophical. \"After a few years at sea I've grown more scared of the Arctic Ocean, but I've also come to respect and value it for all its power and beauty.\" A self-described fighter, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ignored calls for him to step down - until he couldn't. In power since 2015, Trudeau said he would resign after a new leader of his Liberal Party is chosen. The Canadian prime minister says he will step down once his party elects a new leader.

        "title": "Indie band English Teacher kick off BBC's Sound of 2025",
        "short_description": "One of the UK's most promising new guitar bands, English Teacher, have kicked off the countdown of the top five on the BBC's annual list of music's rising stars.",
        "long_description": "One of the UK's most promising new guitar bands, English Teacher, have kicked off the countdown of the top five on the BBC's annual list of music's rising stars. The Leeds quartet have been voted in fifth place in BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025 poll \u2013 with a panel of 180 music industry experts choosing them as one of the acts with \"the best chance of mainstream success\" in the next 12 months. They got well on their way last year. In September, the band beat pop stars like Charli XCX and CMAT to win the Mercury Prize for their debut album, This Could Be Texas. The record deals in sharp portraits of life in sleepy northern towns, where the background hum of racism, loneliness and deprivation is thrown into sharp relief by sublime scenery and lifelong friendships. Their music, meanwhile, is constantly surprising \u2013 full of shifting time signatures, needle-point guitar riffs and soaring melodies that are simultaneously odd and captivating. \"We never really set out with an aim to create something specific,\" says guitarist Lewis Whiting. \"But, that's the fun part, right? Trying to make something new and interesting.\" They say the acclaim they've received so far still doesn't feel real. \"Where we come from, this just doesn't happen,\" says frontwoman Lily Fontaine. \"I keep telling people that I feel like I'm living in a simulation.\" \"It does feel dream-like,\" adds Whiting. \"Best year of my life, craziest year of my life.\" Over the last 12 months, the group have played more than 100 gigs in 16 countries, rising steadily up festival bills as they go, and surviving on \"willpower, laughter and Red Bull\". Along the way, they told journalists their origin story more times than they care to count. Eventually, they got tired of the \"boring\" reality (they met studying music at Leeds Conservatoire) and started inventing less prosaic stories. \"We said we were distant relatives who met at a wedding 20 years ago in Leeds,\" laughs Fontaine. \"They put us at the odd table. We were sort of like the outcasts,\" adds Whiting, continuing the story. \"But we really clicked,\" says Fontaine. \"We started talking about Shakira and how we wanted to be like her, then they played Hips Don't Lie at the disco and we said, 'We should start a band'.\" English Teacher, it should be noted, sound nothing like Shakira. They started out as a dream-pop outfit called Frank and, after the addition of Whiting on guitar, began to lean into a more angular, post-punk sound. Key references include Radiohead, Sonic Youth and Pavement. \"But, famously, we don't agree on our favourite bands,\" says Whiting. One of their first releases was a demo of The World's Biggest Paving Slab, which they put out independently in 2020. Like many of their songs, it draws inspiration from Fontaine's hometown of Colne in Lancashire, where the titular paving stone resides outside the town hall. The lyrics reference a host of local heroes \u2013 from Life On Mars actor John Simm to novelist Charlotte Bronte \u2013 juxtaposing the colour and vigour of the town's history against the social problems it faces in the current day. It's an itch she continues to scratch throughout the band's catalogue, addressing social deprivation and political mismanagement (\"Can the river stop its banks from bursting? / Blame the council, not the rain\") alongside themes of identity, self-doubt and emotional turbulence. Incredibly, she only started writing relatively recently. As a teenager, she'd been in a wedding band with her friend, playing Amy Winehouse and Adele covers. She didn't consider composing until she applied for university. \"I wrote my first song for the audition,\" she recalls. \"It was awful, but it worked. I got a place to study singing and performance, but I very quickly switched to composition, because I was suddenly spending all my time writing songs.\" During that period, English Teacher's members \u2013 completed by drummer Douglas Frost and bassist Nicholas Eden \u2013 circled each other on Leeds' live music scene, playing with various other bands before settling on their current line-up. Their breakthrough came with 2021's R&B, their official debut single, where Fontaine addresses the challenge of being a woman of colour fronting an indie band: (\"Despite appearances, I haven't got the voice for R&B\"). It's a perception she struggled with herself as a teenager, frustrated that she wasn't capable of \"the kind of the vocal runs that the black singers I looked up to were able to do\". As a frontwoman, she developed her own style \u2013 a droll mixture of sprechgesang and her fluttering, airy upper register. But she still encountered prejudice. \"There'd be times where I told people that I made music, and they'd give a certain expression when I said that it was guitar music or it was indie music,\" she says. \"There were a lot of small comments after gigs. People would come up and say, 'Oh, that's not what I was expecting at all',\" adds Whiting. Fontaine is careful not to make too big an issue of it. \"I think I've got a lot of privilege, because I'm quite a light skinned woman of colour,\" she says. \"I think if I was dark skinned it would be even harder - but it did affect me, not seeing people who looked like me in bands. \"I think it made me start a band later in life. Maybe I would have started when I was a teenager, and not when I was leaving university.\" English Teacher's early songs gained an audience during the first wave of the Covid pandemic \u2013 which meant they didn't get to play a gig together until the lockdown ended. Their first show was as part of an all-day mini festival in May 2021, where the audience still had to be seated and socially distanced. \"Those first gigs were kind of jarring,\" Whiting recalls. \"It was quite strange because everything up 'til then felt very online, which doesn't feel as tangible. And then when you go and play a gig, it's like, 'Yeah, this is actually going somewhere.'\" \"We were so nervous, too,\" says Fontaine. \"I feel like it was only late into 2023 that we really found our confidence.\" By that point, they were deep into recording their debut album with Italian producer Marta Salogni (Bjork, Depeche Mode, MIA) \u2013 including new, more polished versions of R&B and The World's Biggest Paving Slab. The band say they put \"immense pressure\" on themselves to perfect the record, fixating on its push-pull dynamics, adding extra layers of context, and experimenting with new instruments. \"It was an intense time in our personal lives, trying to get it finished and out. We gave a lot to it,\" says Whiting. \"Recording your first album is just a huge opportunity,\" continues Fontaine. \"I think we were very aware of that.\" The hard work paid off. Record Collector Magazine called This Could Be Texas \"one of the most confident and charismatic debuts in years\". The Mercury Prize judges said the band's \"winning lyrical mix of surrealism and social observation... displays a fresh approach to the traditional guitar band format\". The quartet are endearingly amazed that anyone paid attention at all. \"I wasn't sure that it would connect with people, because the lyrics are quite specific to the area I grew up in,\" says Fontaine. Instead, it was the bigger themes \u2013 of leaving home and finding your place in a world that's \"going up in flames\" \u2013 that helped them find an ever-growing audience. On The World's Biggest Paving Slab, Fontaine mockingly describes herself as \"the world's smallest celebrity\" \u2013 a lyric that's rapidly becoming obsolete. \"I'm not the smallest, but certainly not the biggest,\" she laughs. \"In the alphabet of celebrity, I'm probably on the X-list.\" One act from the BBC Sound of 2025 top five will be revealed on Radio 1 and BBC News every day this week, culminating with the winner on Friday. The Bristol Beacon is giving local performers studio time and money to help them make music. A group of musicians who met 40 years ago join together to help raise funds for a music charity. The rock legend will now headline despite initially criticising what he called \"corporate control\". The guitarist and singer, who co-wrote some of the family's biggest hits, dies at the age of 73.

        "long_description": "January 6, 2025 10:27 am The Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, has stated that a new constitution is essential for ensuring democratic governance. Cardinal Ranjith emphasizes that a new constitution is required to establish a strong mechanism for investigating corruption that undermines democracy. A meeting between the Speaker of Parliament, Dr. Jagath Wickramaratne, and the Archbishop of Colombo was held last afternoon (5), after which the Cardinal made the following comments to the media. \u201cIt is very important to reveal the true information behind the Easter Sunday attack. A comprehensive investigation should be conducted into who was responsible, why it happened, and who helped in the attack. Many similar incidents have occurred in Sri Lanka in the past, including cases of murder, disappearances, and others, which have not been properly investigated,\u201d Cardinal Ranjith added. The Cardinal also urged that a necessary mechanism be established to investigate all acts of corruption undermining democracy. He emphasized that constitutional changes are crucial for this purpose and mentioned that a new constitution is required to address the flaws in the existing one.",

        "title": "No direct talks with foreign missions: New circular tightens Sri Lanka\u0092s diplomatic protocols ",
        "short_description": "January 6, 2025 11:41 am",
        "long_description": "January 6, 2025 11:41 am The government has introduced a comprehensive set of guidelines aimed at streamlining and ensuring coordinated communication between the state institutions and foreign entities. Accordingly, the government has issued a circular, effective from January 1, 2025, in order to safeguard national interests and prevent diplomatic complications. As per the new circular, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will serve as the lead institution for all international relations while making it compulsory to obtain the President\u2019s pre-approval for all foreign visits by government officials. The guidelines emphasize strengthening the role of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ensuring clarity in communication protocols, and establishing a clear framework for international agreements, foreign financing, and diplomatic protocols. At the core of the circular lies the assertion that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will serve as the lead institution for conducting international relations, as outlined in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Going forward, all communication with foreign governments or international organizations must be coordinated through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The circular also establishes clear communication protocols, stressing that no direct communication with foreign governments should occur without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. All Provincial Councils and Local Government institutions are strictly prohibited from engaging with foreign missions, both in Sri Lanka and abroad, without Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 approval. Meanwhile, the circular also noted that the ministries such as Finance or Defence may still engage with foreign entities on specific issues, such as loans or technical matters, but only after prior consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In response to the growing complexities of international travel and participation in diplomatic events, the circular introduces new rules for foreign visits: - All foreign visits must be pre-approved by the President and coordinated through the MFA to prevent last-minute complications or overlooked diplomatic nuances. - Senior officials travelling for official purposes must inform the MFA well in advance. - The Ministry will also coordinate visa requests for these officials, which must be submitted at least four weeks prior to departure. In addition, the circular stipulates that senior officials travelling for official purposes are entitled to transportation and consular support; however, private visits will not be funded by the Ministry unless explicitly authorized. The circular also states that costs related to accommodation, travel, or communication services are typically borne by the respective ministry organizing the trip. The circular also includes protocols for emergency contacts by foreign missions and informal communications. - In the event of an emergency, foreign missions are permitted to contact the relevant ministries directly. - However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be notified promptly to avoid misunderstandings or the potential for diplomatic fallout. Similarly, any informal correspondence with foreign missions must be reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, especially if it could evolve into a more significant policy issue. When meeting foreign ministers, dignitaries, or ambassadors, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are mandatory to be invited. If not, a report must be submitted to the Ministry detailing the discussion that took place during the meeting. The circular further states that senior officials of the Government of Sri Lanka should not attend events hosted by representatives of countries with which Sri Lanka does not have diplomatic relations or recognition. In such cases, inquiries can be directed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for clarification. Before initiating discussions for bilateral, regional, or multilateral agreements or memoranda of understanding with foreign entities, ministries must first notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Any formal agreements or Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) must be cleared by the Ministry to assess potential policy or legal implications. The circular also outlines participation in diplomatic events. It states that the Cabinet will nominate a Minister each month to represent Sri Lanka at the National Day celebrations of foreign countries. If the nominated Minister is unable to attend, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be informed at least two weeks in advance to make alternative arrangements.",

        "short_description": "January 6, 2025 11:43 am",
        "long_description": "January 6, 2025 11:43 am India has detected its first suspected Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) case in Bengaluru in an eight-month old baby. Sources from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) said that the suspected case was detected through a private laboratory, and that the patient and its family have no travel history. \u201cThe case has come from Hunasanahalli in Bengaluru Rural district. The child has been admitted to the Bengaluru Baptist Hospital,\u201d the source said, adding the child will be discharged today. HMPV is a viral respiratory infection that causes symptoms resembling the common cold. It spreads via droplets, direct contact, and possibly airborne particles. Symptoms range from mild, such as a runny nose, to severe, including breathing difficulties and chest pain. The Centre had last week announced that it is closely monitoring the situation following a surge in respiratory illnesses in China, adding that there was no cause for panic as the virus was not new to India. Medical experts say that the virus has been present in India for years and predominantly impacts paediatric population between six to twelve months of age, though it can also be present in children up to fourteen years old. Addressing concerns, Director General Health Services (DGHS) Atul Goel on Friday had said that HMPV is similar to other respiratory viruses, causing flu-like symptoms in very young children. \u201dThere was no significant increase in respiratory illness cases reported at our centres in December 2024,\u201d he had said. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) had also convened a joint monitoring group meeting over the issue to assess the outbreak on Saturday. \u201dThe government will continue to keep a close watch on the outbreak through all available channels,\u201d the ministry had stated. It added that the World Health Organization (WHO) has also been requested to provide timely updates on the situation in China. To strengthen preparedness, the group has recommended increasing the number of laboratories testing for HMPV under Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)\u2019s network, to monitor HMPV trends throughout the year. Taking cue, health departments of several states such as Karnataka, Delhi and Kerala have started monitoring to look out for cases of HMPV, with ministers or departments sharing public statements over preparedness. Kerala Health Minister Veena George on Saturday had said that the state was closely monitoring the recent reports of an outbreak of HMPV in China. Similarly, the Karnataka health department is also expected to issue an advisory on precautionary measures by Monday afternoon. Source: Business Standard --Agencies",
