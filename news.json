        "long_description": "A thick blanket of fog has engulfed Delhi and adjoining areas in northern India, leading to travel delays and chaos. More than 100 flights were delayed at the Delhi airport on Friday morning, according to PTI news agency. Dozens of trains have also been rescheduled, or are running late. India's weather department has said that foggy conditions are likely to continue for the next few days. Dense fog is common at this time of the year in Delhi and other parts of northern India, as the region grapples with an intense cold wave. Photos and videos showed several cities shrouded in dense mist and haze. Around nine airports including the one in Delhi experienced zero visibility on Friday morning, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The Delhi airport has issued an advisory to passengers, warning them of significant delays. \"While landing and take-off continue at Delhi airport, flights that are not CAT III compliant may get affected,\" the airport said in a statement, referring to the radar system that enables automatic landings when there is very low visibility. Several airlines have also issued statements urging travellers to check flight schedules before planning their journeys. IMD considers fog \"dense\" if visibility drops below 200m and \"very dense\" if it falls below 50m. The weather department has said that Delhi may experience light to moderate rainfall on 6 January, which is likely to further lower temperatures.

        "long_description": "An eight-year-old boy has been found alive after surviving five days in a game park inhabited by lions and elephants in northern Zimbabwe, according to a member of parliament. The ordeal began when Tinotenda Pudu wandered 23 km (14 miles) from home into the \"perilous\" Matusadona Game Park, said Mashonaland West MP Mutsa Murombedzi on X. He spent five days \"sleeping on a rocky perch, amidst roaring lions, passing elephants, eating wild fruits\", she said. Matusadona game park has about 40 lions. At one point, it had one of the highest lion population densities in Africa, according to African Parks. The Zimbabwe Parks & Wildlife Management Authority confirmed the incident to the BBC but did not share any further details. Murombedzi said the boy used his knowledge of the wild and survival skills to stay alive. Tinotenda survived his ordeal by eating wild fruit. He also dug small wells into dry riverbeds with a stick to access drinking water - a skill taught in the drought-prone area. Members of the local Nyaminyami community started a search party and beat drums each day to try and guide him back home. But ultimately, it was park rangers who managed to find him. On his fifth day in the wild, Tinotenda heard a ranger's car and ran toward it, narrowly missing it, the MP said. Luckily, the rangers returned, spotted \"fresh little human footprints,\" and searched the area until they found him. \"This was probably his last chance of being rescued after 5 days in the wilderness,\" said the MP. The park is over 1,470 sq km (570 sq miles) and is home to zebras, elephants, hippos, lions, and antelope. Across social media, people have been praising the young boy for his resilience. \"This is beyond human comprehension,\" one person wrote on X.

        "title": "To conserve or cull? Life in Australia's crocodile capital",
        "short_description": "It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap.",
        "long_description": "It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap. Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent \u2013 that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap. \"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,\" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile. We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world. The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands. And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs. Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago. After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000. But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast. They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened. The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside. \"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb. \"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.\" The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant. There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia. While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive. Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen. Last year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018. This is busiest time of year for Ewin and his colleagues. Breeding season has just started, which means salties are on the move. His team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin. The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers. The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour. \"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman. \"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\" Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education. The NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats. It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions. \"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT. \"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\" In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species. Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200. This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans. Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people. In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT. Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs. It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT. Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates. The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather. Visitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch \"croc jumping\" - which involves salties being fed bits of meat on the end of a stick if they can leap out of the water for their audience. \"I'm supposed to tell you to put your [life-jackets] on,\" jokes the head skipper at Spectacular Jumping Croc Cruises, Alex 'Wookie' Williams, as he explains the house rules of the boat. \"The bit I don't have to tell you\u2026 [is that] life jackets are pretty useless out here.\" For Williams, who's been obsessed with crocs since childhood, there's plenty of opportunity to work alongside them. \"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,\" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region. Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver. It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT. Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; \u00a3398,000) - have all invested in the industry. \"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,\" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands. His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres. Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry. One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry. For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods. \"My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,\" the Balngarra man says. \"Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles.\" But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation. The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity. Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity. Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved. But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined. \"If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed,\" says Prof Webb matter-of-factly. \"The only question is whether it's going to take five minutes or 10 minutes. I don't think you'll ever get to 15 - you'll be torn apart,\" he adds, pushing up his trouser leg to reveal a huge scar on his calf - evidence of a close encounter with one angry female nearly forty years ago as he was collecting eggs. He is unapologetic about what he calls the pragmatism of authorities to manage numbers and make money out of crocs along the way - a way of life that, in the near future at least, is here to stay. \"We've done what very few people can do, which is take a very serious predator\u2026and then manage them in such a way that the public is prepared to [tolerate] them. \"You try and get people in Sydney or London or New York to put up with a serious predator - they aren't going to do it.\" Australia's Steve Smith claims a catch that would have dismissed Virat Kohli first ball, but the officials rule in favour of the Indian batter on day one of the fifth Test. Scott Boland takes the wickets of Rishabh Pant and Nitish Kumar Reddy in consecutive deliveries as Australia take control on the first day of the fifth Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Former Australia opener Justin Langer is appointed head coach of London Spirit following Trevor Bayliss' departure last month.

        "long_description": "Rosita Missoni, co-founder of the eponymous Italian knitwear label Missoni, has died aged 93. The news was confirmed by the president of Italy's Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, who praised the brand's iconic \"multicoloured textures\". He described her death as \"a great loss for Italy, Lombardy and for the province of Varese where she was born and lived\". Rosita founded the luxury brand - which became known for its zig-zag motif - in the northern Italian region with her husband Ottavio in 1953. Rosita, whose parents were shawlmakers, was born in 1931 in the town of Golasecca, Lombardy. While on a study trip to learn English in London, she met Ottavio - known as Tai - while he was competing in the 400m hurdles at the 1948 Olympic Games. At the time, Tai was producing his own knit tracksuits, including bottoms with a zip so they could be put on over trainers. \"When I got married, four sewing machines arrived with my husband,\" Rosita told the AFP news agency in a 2016 interview. The pair, who married in 1953, initially set up a machine-knitwear workshop in Gallarate, northwest of Milan. Their big break came in 1958 when a Milanese department store ordered hundreds of Missoni-labelled striped dresses. Missoni's first catwalk show came in 1966, followed by a presentation at the Pitti Palace in Florence the following year. A controversy over the see-through quality of clothing, after models were asked to remove their white bras because they could be seen under blouses, propelled the brand into global fame. Tai died in 2013, aged 92. The couple's daughter, Angela, took over the fashion house in the late 1990s, although Rosita continued to work on the label's home line, Missoni Home. Slowing down climate change is an immense task, but small individual actions can add up to help reduce emissions. These big comebacks, awards contenders and cultural heavyweights should be highlights of the year.

        "long_description": "January 2, 2025 09:08 pm The Sri Lankan government has announced new restrictions on marketing food and beverages to children, effective January 1, 2025, under the Food (Labelling & Advertising) Regulations 2022. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, through its Food & Beverage Steering Committee, was a key partner in shaping these regulations by providing inputs on food science, nutrition, international regulatory practices, and legal frameworks during an over decade-long consultation process with the Ministry of Health. Under the new rules, the industry must ensure that children under 12 are not featured in advertisements for F&B products. Further, the industry must ensure that F&B products are not advertised or promoted to children below 12 years without prior approval from the Ministry of Health. Additionally, updated food labelling requirements, effective July 1, 2025, will empower consumers with essential information, including nutritional values and detailed ingredient lists, to make informed food choices, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce stated in a statement. These updates address gaps in the regulations established in 2005 and align the framework with international standards, it said. Mr. Buwanekabahu Perera, CEO of The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, stated: \u201cWe commend the Ministry of Health for modernising Sri Lanka\u2019s food regulatory framework after 20 years. Transitioning entrenched industry practices will be challenging for businesses, from SMEs to large-scale operators. However, it is vital to balance consumer protection with the continued availability of packaged food, and preserving longstanding brand equity. A corrective and collaborative approach to implementing these regulations will be important to ensure a smooth transition.\u201d Copyright \u00a92025 Ada Derana. All rights reserved.

        "long_description": "January 2, 2025 06:30 pm A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between India and Sri Lanka for rehabilitation of the Karainagar Boatyard in Northern Province of Sri Lanka with grant assistance from the Government of India to the tune of LKR 290 million. The MoU was signed and exchanged by High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Santosh Jha and the then High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to India Kshenuka Dhireni Senewiratne on December 16, 2024. Issuing a statement, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said the project envisages rehabilitation of Karainagar Boatyard of the Cey-Nor Foundation Ltd, incorporated under the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and operating under the Ministry of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources. The project will cover civil works and procurement including installation of plant, machinery, equipment, material, services etc. Once fully operational, the rehabilitated boatyard will augment livelihood opportunities of local fishermen, create more job opportunities in the area including through small establishments around the boatyard, and help enhance the supply of quality fisheries products, the statement added. With a development cooperation portfolio with Sri Lanka of over USD 5 billion, India\u2019s people-centric development assistance initiatives in virtually all major sectors are making a tangible difference to the daily lives of the people of Sri Lanka across all the 25 districts of the country, the Indian High Commission noted. Notable past projects in the Northern Province include construction and renovation of over 41000 houses; a state-of-the-art Cultural Centre at Jaffna as a reconciliation project; removal of wrecks and dredging at Kankensanthurai Port; construction and repairs at numerous schools and hospitals across Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaithivu, Vavuniya; restoration of Thiruketeeswaram Temple; distribution of significant quantities of assistance to the agricultural community, as well as fishing community including boats, nets, outboard motors, freezers, etc; among numerous others, the statement highlighted.

        "long_description": "January 3, 2025 07:45 am Two people were killed and 18 injured when a small plane crashed through the rooftop of a commercial building in Southern California on Thursday, police said. Police got a report at 2:09 p.m. about the crash in the Orange County city of Fullerton, said Kristy Wells, a Fullerton police spokesperson. Firefighters and police arrived on scene and battled a blaze that broke out, and evacuated surrounding businesses, Wells said. The fire damaged the warehouse, which appeared to contain sewing machines and textile stock. The building was occupied by Michael Nicholas Designs, a furniture upholstery manufacturer, according to a sign on a door. Ten people were taken to the hospital, while eight were treated and released at the scene, police said. There were two confirmed deaths, according to Wells. It was not immediately known what type of plane it was or whether those injured were in the aircraft or on the ground, Wells said. The flight-tracking website FlightAware shows a four-seat, single-engine aircraft crashed about a minute after takeoff. Security camera footage from Rucci Forge, a wheel manufacturer across the street, shows a fiery explosion and a large plume of black smoke as the plane appeared to dive into the building tilted on its side. The plane crashed near the Fullerton Municipal Airport, a general aviation airport in Orange County that is about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from Disneyland. It has one runway and one heliport. Metrolink, a regional train line, is nearby, and flanks a residential neighborhood and commercial warehouse buildings. Another four-seat plane crashed into a tree a half-mile from the airport last November while making an emergency landing right after it had taken off, the Orange County Register reported. Both people on board suffered moderate injuries. Fullerton is a city of about 140,000 people some 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles.
